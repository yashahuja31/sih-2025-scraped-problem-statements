      "Problem Statement Title": "lmage based Animal Type Classification for cattle and buffaloes×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID25005Problem Statement Titlelmage based Animal Type Classification for cattle and buffaloesDescriptionBackground:In dairy farming, evaluating the body structure of animals is vital to predict their longevity, productivity, and reproductive efficiency. Traditionally, Animal Type Classification (ATC)—which involves scoring animals for physical traits—is conducted by trained personnel through visual inspection and manual measurement of specific body parts. However, this manual method is prone to human error and subjectivity, even with trained professionals, resulting in inconsistent and potentially unreliable data.With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image processing technologies, there is an opportunity to automate this process. Automated scoring based on images can ensure standardization, minimize observer bias, and improve the reliability of data captured for scientific and breeding purposes.Description:The Government of India is implementing the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) since December 2014, aiming to conserve and develop indigenous bovine breeds, genetically upgrade the bovine population, and enhance milk productivity. Under this mission, Progeny Testing (PT) and Pedigree Selection (PS) programs are being carried out in key dairy breeds across the country to produce high genetic merit bulls for breeding purposes.Animal Type Classification (ATC) is a crucial step in identifying top-performing elite dams, which are potential mothers of future breeding bulls. Currently, ATC is performed manually by a trained Animal Typer who visually examines and measures physical traits, and then records the scores in the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA). Despite training, errors due to fatigue, bias, or measurement inaccuracies can adversely affect data quality and scientific analysis.There is a need for an AI-driven solution that can automate this classification process by analyzing animal images, extracting body structure parameters, and assigning standardized scores with minimal human intervention. If integrated with BPA, such a solution would enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scientific validity of animal evaluation under PT and PS programs.Expected Solution:Students are expected to develop an AI-based Auto Recording of Animal Type Classification System that can:Use images of cattle and buffaloes to evaluate physical traits relevant to Animal Type Classification.Extract and quantify specific body structure parameters (e.g., body length, height at withers, chest width, rump angle, etc.) using AI and image processing techniques.Generate objective and consistent classification scores.Auto-record and store the classification data in a structured format.Provide seamless integration with BPA to auto-save the classification records at the time of evaluation.Be user-friendly and operable by field personnel with minimal technical skills.OrganizationMinistry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & DairyingDepartmentDepartment of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)CategorySoftwareThemeAgriculture, FoodTech & Rural DevelopmentYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",

Many residents lack timely medical care, leading to worsened health outcomes and increased financial strain.Impact / Why this problem needs to be solvedThis problem directly affects the health and livelihood of thousands of rural residents, especially daily-wage earners and farmers. Lack of accessible healthcare leads to preventable complications, financial losses, and overall decline in community well-being. Addressing this issue would improve healthcare delivery, reduce unnecessary travel, and enhance quality of life for a large, underserved population.Expected Outcomes• A multilingual telemedicine app for video consultations with doctors.• Digital health records accessible offline for rural patients.• Real-time updates on medicine availability at local pharmacies.• AI-powered symptom checker optimized for low-bandwidth areas.• A scalable solution for other rural regions in India.Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries• Rural patients in Nabha and surrounding villages.• Nabha Civil Hospital staff.• Punjab Health Department.• Local pharmacies.• Daily-wage workers and farmers.Supporting Data• Nabha Civil Hospital serves 173 villages but has only 11 out of 23 sanctioned doctors.• Only 31% of rural Punjab households have internet access, highlighting the need for offline features.• Telemedicine adoption in India is growing at a 31% CAGR (2020–2025).• Sources: Local news reports and government health statistics.",

      "Problem Statement Title": "Maximizing Section Throughput Using Al-Powered Precise Train Traffic Control×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID25022Problem Statement TitleMaximizing Section Throughput Using Al-Powered Precise Train Traffic ControlDescriptionBackgroundIndian Railways manages train movements primarily through the experience of train traffic controllers. While effective, this manual approach faces limitations as network congestion and operational complexity grow. Trains of varying types and priorities must share limited track infrastructure across space and time, making optimal allocation a significant challenge. The problem is a large-scale combinatorial optimization task with numerous constraints such as safety, track resources, system of working, signalling system, platform availability, train schedules, and train priorities. As real-time decisions become increasingly complex, there is a growing need for intelligent, data-driven systems powered by optimization algorithms and AI to enhance efficiency, punctuality, and utilization of railway infrastructure.Detailed DescriptionCurrently, experienced traffic controllers oversee operations and take real-time decisions—whether a train should proceed, halt, or be rerouted—based on operational conditions and institutional knowledge. With rising traffic volumes and higher expectations for punctuality, safety, and efficiency, manual decision-making alone is becoming insufficient.The network is constrained by finite infrastructure—limited track sections, junctions, crossings, and platform capacities—shared by long-distance express, suburban local, freight, maintenance blocks, and unscheduled specials. Coordinating these movements across spatial (network layout) and temporal (scheduling) dimensions while maintaining safety and minimizing delays is formidable.Within a section managed by a section controller, the core problem is to decide train precedence and crossings to maximize throughput and minimize overall train travel time, considering section characteristics (e.g., line capacity, gradients, signal placements) and varying train priorities. This represents a dynamic, large-scale combinatorial optimization problem with an exponentially large solution space, further complicated by real-time disruptions (breakdowns, weather, rolling stock delays). Human intuition alone is no longer sufficient; intelligent decision-support tools are required to improve precision, scalability, and responsiveness.Expected SolutionAn intelligent decision-support system that assists section controllers in making optimized, real-time decisions for train precedence and crossings. The system should:• Leverage operations research and AI to model constraints, train priorities, and operational rules, producing conflict-free, feasible schedules dynamically.• Maximize section throughput and minimize overall train travel time, with the ability to re-optimize rapidly under disruptions (e.g., incidents, delays, weather).• Support what-if simulation and scenario analysis to evaluate alternative routings, holding strategies, and platform allocations.• Provide a user-friendly interface for controllers with clear recommendations, explanations, and override capabilities.• Integrate with existing railway control systems and data sources (signalling, TMS, timetables, rolling stock status) via secure APIs.• Include audit trails, performance dashboards, and KPIs (punctuality, average delay, throughput, utilization) for continuous improvement.OrganizationMinistry of RailwaysDepartmentMinistry of RailwaysCategorySoftwareThemeTransportation & LogisticsYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",

      "Problem Statement Title": "Develop a blockchain-based system for botanical traceability of Ayurvedic herbs, including geo-tagging from the point of collection (farmers/wild collectors) to the final Ayurvedic formulation label.×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID25027Problem Statement TitleDevelop a blockchain-based system for botanical traceability of Ayurvedic herbs, including geo-tagging from the point of collection (farmers/wild collectors) to the final Ayurvedic formulation label.DescriptionBackgroundThe Ayurvedic herbal supply chain in India is characterised by fragmented networks of smallholder farmers, wild collectors and multiple intermediaries, leading to challenges in ensuring consistent quality, authenticity and sustainable sourcing of medicinal plants. Variations in harvesting practices, environmental conditions and manual record-keeping introduce risks of mislabeling, adulteration and over-harvesting of vulnerable species, undermining consumer trust and compliance with regulatory standards. Geographic provenance is often undocumented or opaque, making it difficult for manufacturers and regulators to verify that herbs originate from approved regions or follow sustainable collection guidelines.A blockchain-based traceability system, augmented with geo-tagging technology, can address these gaps by creating an immutable, decentralised ledger that records every step of the herb's journey—from on-site GPS-tagged collection events through processing, testing and formulation. Smart contracts on a permissioned network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) can enforce sustainability criteria and automate quality validations, while IoT-enabled devices capture real-time location and environmental data at remote collection points, even via SMS-over-blockchain gateways where connectivity is sparse. By integrating FHIR-style metadata bundles (e.g., \"CollectionEvent,\" \"QualityTest,\" \"ProcessingStep\") and QR-code scanning at aggregation nodes, stakeholders gain end-to-end visibility, enabling rapid verification of provenance, streamlined certification for export and robust audit trails to support both biodiversity conservation and supply-chain efficiency. When herbs are formulated into finished products, unique, serialised QR codes generated by the blockchain platform could be affixed to each package. End customers scan these codes with a mobile app or web portal—powered by the same blockchain ledger—to retrieve a FHIR-style provenance bundle detailing each upstream event: farm of origin, harvest conditions, intermediary custody, laboratory certificates and batch formulation parameters. This consumer-facing transparency not only verifies authenticity and builds trust, but also supports ethical marketing, enables rapid recall management and fosters incentives for sustainable collection practices by linking premium pricing to verified harvest data. Over time, analytics on consumer scans can feed back into demand forecasting, closing the loop between consumer assurance and supply-chain optimisation.DescriptionA permissioned blockchain network will immutably record every stage of an Ayurvedic herb's journey—from geo-tagged harvest events by farmers or wild collectors, through multi-stage processing and laboratory testing, to the finished product on retail shelves. At the point of collection, GPS-enabled mobile or IoT devices capture precise location, timestamp, collector identity, species identification and initial quality metrics as a \"Collection Event.\" Subsequent \"Processing Step\" and \"Quality Test\" events—each embedding standardised metadata bundles—are added by processing facilities and testing laboratories. Smart contracts enforce National Medicinal Plants Board sustainability guidelines and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices by automatically validating geo-fencing rules, seasonal restrictions and quality thresholds before committing each transaction to the ledger.When formulation is complete, unique QR codes generated on-chain are affixed to product packaging. End customers scan these codes via a lightweight web or mobile portal (no specialised app required) to retrieve the full provenance record: farm coordinates and harvest conditions; chain-of-custody handoffs; lab certificates for moisture, pesticide and DNA-barcode tests; and sustainability and fair-trade compliance proofs. This consumer-facing transparency assures authenticity and safety, enables rapid recall notifications for affected batches and tells the story of each product—complete with interactive maps and farmer or community profiles. By combining tamper-proof audit trails, geo-tagged traceability and automated compliance enforcement, the system delivers a replicable model for ethical, sustainable and trust-driven Ayurvedic herb sourcing.Expected SolutionParticipants will deliver a proof-of-concept blockchain-based botanical traceability system addressing end-to-end provenance of Ayurvedic herbs. The solution should include the following core components and capabilities:1. Permissioned Blockchain Network• A lightweight, permissioned ledger (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric or Corda) that records every supply-chain transaction.• Network nodes representing farmers' cooperatives, wild-collector groups, testing laboratories, processing facilities and manufacturers.• Smart contracts enforcing:- Geo-fencing rules based on collectors' GPS coordinates and approved harvesting zones.- Seasonal-harvest restrictions and species-specific conservation limits per National Medicinal Plants Board guidelines.- Quality-gate validations (e.g., moisture thresholds, pesticide limits, DNA barcoding checks).2. Geo-Tagged Data Capture• IoT/GPS-enabled mobile DApp (or SMS-over-blockchain gateway) for collectors to record \"CollectionEvent\" metadata: latitude/longitude, timestamp, collector ID, species and initial quality metrics.• Sensor integrations or manual interfaces for \"QualityTest\" events (lab results) and \"ProcessingStep\" events (drying, grinding, storage conditions).3. Smart Labeling & Consumer Portal• On-chain generation of unique QR codes for each finished product batch.• A lightweight web/mobile portal (no specialised install required) allowing end customers to scan QR codes and retrieve a complete FHIR-style provenance bundle:- Collection location map and harvest details- Chain-of-custody handoffs through each supply-chain node- Laboratory certificates for moisture, pesticide analysis, DNA authentication- Sustainability compliance proofs and fair-trade verifications- Interactive farmer/community profiles and conservation credentials4. Integration & Interoperability• RESTful APIs for supply-chain managers to query real-time dashboards of harvest volumes, batch statuses, QA results and sustainability metrics.• Plugins or connectors to existing ERP/quality-management systems for seamless data exchange.• Use of FHIR-style resource models (CollectionEvent, QualityTest, ProcessingStep, Provenance) for standardized metadata exchange.5.

      "Theme": "Develop a blockchain-based system for botanical traceability of Ayurvedic herbs, including geo-tagging from the point of collection (farmers/wild collectors) to the final Ayurvedic formulation label.",
      "column_7": "Description",
      "column_8": "BackgroundThe Ayurvedic herbal supply chain in India is characterised by fragmented networks of smallholder farmers, wild collectors and multiple intermediaries, leading to challenges in ensuring consistent quality, authenticity and sustainable sourcing of medicinal plants. Variations in harvesting practices, environmental conditions and manual record-keeping introduce risks of mislabeling, adulteration and over-harvesting of vulnerable species, undermining consumer trust and compliance with regulatory standards. Geographic provenance is often undocumented or opaque, making it difficult for manufacturers and regulators to verify that herbs originate from approved regions or follow sustainable collection guidelines.A blockchain-based traceability system, augmented with geo-tagging technology, can address these gaps by creating an immutable, decentralised ledger that records every step of the herb's journey—from on-site GPS-tagged collection events through processing, testing and formulation. Smart contracts on a permissioned network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) can enforce sustainability criteria and automate quality validations, while IoT-enabled devices capture real-time location and environmental data at remote collection points, even via SMS-over-blockchain gateways where connectivity is sparse. By integrating FHIR-style metadata bundles (e.g., \"CollectionEvent,\" \"QualityTest,\" \"ProcessingStep\") and QR-code scanning at aggregation nodes, stakeholders gain end-to-end visibility, enabling rapid verification of provenance, streamlined certification for export and robust audit trails to support both biodiversity conservation and supply-chain efficiency. When herbs are formulated into finished products, unique, serialised QR codes generated by the blockchain platform could be affixed to each package. End customers scan these codes with a mobile app or web portal—powered by the same blockchain ledger—to retrieve a FHIR-style provenance bundle detailing each upstream event: farm of origin, harvest conditions, intermediary custody, laboratory certificates and batch formulation parameters. This consumer-facing transparency not only verifies authenticity and builds trust, but also supports ethical marketing, enables rapid recall management and fosters incentives for sustainable collection practices by linking premium pricing to verified harvest data. Over time, analytics on consumer scans can feed back into demand forecasting, closing the loop between consumer assurance and supply-chain optimisation.DescriptionA permissioned blockchain network will immutably record every stage of an Ayurvedic herb's journey—from geo-tagged harvest events by farmers or wild collectors, through multi-stage processing and laboratory testing, to the finished product on retail shelves. At the point of collection, GPS-enabled mobile or IoT devices capture precise location, timestamp, collector identity, species identification and initial quality metrics as a \"Collection Event.\" Subsequent \"Processing Step\" and \"Quality Test\" events—each embedding standardised metadata bundles—are added by processing facilities and testing laboratories. Smart contracts enforce National Medicinal Plants Board sustainability guidelines and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices by automatically validating geo-fencing rules, seasonal restrictions and quality thresholds before committing each transaction to the ledger.When formulation is complete, unique QR codes generated on-chain are affixed to product packaging. End customers scan these codes via a lightweight web or mobile portal (no specialised app required) to retrieve the full provenance record: farm coordinates and harvest conditions; chain-of-custody handoffs; lab certificates for moisture, pesticide and DNA-barcode tests; and sustainability and fair-trade compliance proofs. This consumer-facing transparency assures authenticity and safety, enables rapid recall notifications for affected batches and tells the story of each product—complete with interactive maps and farmer or community profiles. By combining tamper-proof audit trails, geo-tagged traceability and automated compliance enforcement, the system delivers a replicable model for ethical, sustainable and trust-driven Ayurvedic herb sourcing.Expected SolutionParticipants will deliver a proof-of-concept blockchain-based botanical traceability system addressing end-to-end provenance of Ayurvedic herbs. The solution should include the following core components and capabilities:1. Permissioned Blockchain Network• A lightweight, permissioned ledger (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric or Corda) that records every supply-chain transaction.• Network nodes representing farmers' cooperatives, wild-collector groups, testing laboratories, processing facilities and manufacturers.• Smart contracts enforcing:- Geo-fencing rules based on collectors' GPS coordinates and approved harvesting zones.- Seasonal-harvest restrictions and species-specific conservation limits per National Medicinal Plants Board guidelines.- Quality-gate validations (e.g., moisture thresholds, pesticide limits, DNA barcoding checks).2. Geo-Tagged Data Capture• IoT/GPS-enabled mobile DApp (or SMS-over-blockchain gateway) for collectors to record \"CollectionEvent\" metadata: latitude/longitude, timestamp, collector ID, species and initial quality metrics.• Sensor integrations or manual interfaces for \"QualityTest\" events (lab results) and \"ProcessingStep\" events (drying, grinding, storage conditions).3. Smart Labeling & Consumer Portal• On-chain generation of unique QR codes for each finished product batch.• A lightweight web/mobile portal (no specialised install required) allowing end customers to scan QR codes and retrieve a complete FHIR-style provenance bundle:- Collection location map and harvest details- Chain-of-custody handoffs through each supply-chain node- Laboratory certificates for moisture, pesticide analysis, DNA authentication- Sustainability compliance proofs and fair-trade verifications- Interactive farmer/community profiles and conservation credentials4. Integration & Interoperability• RESTful APIs for supply-chain managers to query real-time dashboards of harvest volumes, batch statuses, QA results and sustainability metrics.• Plugins or connectors to existing ERP/quality-management systems for seamless data exchange.• Use of FHIR-style resource models (CollectionEvent, QualityTest, ProcessingStep, Provenance) for standardized metadata exchange.5. User Interfaces & Reporting• A mobile DApp interface optimized for low-bandwidth rural environments, with offline data capture and SMS synchronization.• A web dashboard for stakeholders to monitor network health, query provenance records and generate compliance reports aligned with AYUSH Ministry export and sustainability requirements.• Automated reporting modules that compile environmental-impact metrics and conservation compliance data for certification bodies.6.

These particles originate from the degradation of larger plastics or from microbeads in consumer products. Their persistence and bioaccumulative nature pose serious risks to aquatic life, ecosystems, and potentially human health. Current methods for detecting microplastics — such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy — are often accurate but time-consuming, expensive, and laboratory-dependent, limiting their application for real-time, field-based monitoring.DescriptionThe project aims to develop a low-cost, efficient, and portable sensor capable of detecting microplastics in various water sources. The focus may be on using optical detection techniques — such as light scattering, fluorescence, or absorbance — combined with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition. The sensor may be designed to identify microplastic particles based on their optical signatures, size distribution, and possibly polymer type. Water samples shall pass through a detection chamber, where embedded sensors capture spectral or visual data. This information would be processed in real time, either on-device or via a connected application. The system should be tested using standard microplastic samples (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene) and validated against existing lab-based techniques.Expected SolutionThe expected outcome is a compact, field-deployable sensor system that can detect and quantify microplastics in water samples within minutes. It should offer reasonable sensitivity (down to 10–100 μm), operate on battery or solar power, and require minimal sample preparation. Additionally, the solution may include a companion software interface for data logging, visualization, and analysis.

      "Problem Statement Title": "Identifying Taxonomy and Assessing Biodiversity from eDNA Datasets×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID25042Problem Statement TitleIdentifying Taxonomy and Assessing Biodiversity from eDNA DatasetsDescriptionBackgroundThe deep ocean, encompassing vast and remote ecosystems like abyssal plains, hydrothermal vents, and seamounts, harbors a significant portion of global biodiversity, much of which remains undiscovered due to its inaccessibility. Understanding deep-sea biodiversity is critical for elucidating ecological interactions (e.g., food webs, nutrient cycling), informing conservation strategies for vulnerable marine habitats, and identifying novel eukaryotic species with potential biotechnological or ecological significance.Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive tool for studying these ecosystems by capturing genetic traces of organisms from environmental samples, such as seawater or sediment, without the need for physical collection or disturbance of fragile habitats. By targeting marker genes like 18S rRNA or COI, eDNA enables the detection of diverse eukaryotic taxa, including protists, cnidarians, and rare metazoans, offering insights into species richness and community structure.DescriptionThe Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE) will undertake routine voyages to the deep sea and collect sediment and water samples from hotspot regions for biodiversity assessment and ecosystem monitoring. The water and sediment samples will be used to extract eDNA and will be subject to high-throughput sequencing.However, assigning raw eDNA sequencing reads to eukaryotic taxa or inferring their ecological roles presents significant challenges, primarily due to the poor representation of deep-sea organisms in reference databases like SILVA, PR2, or NCBI. These databases, built primarily from well-studied terrestrial or shallow-water species, lack comprehensive sequences for deep-sea eukaryotes, leading to misclassifications, unassigned reads, or underestimation of biodiversity.Traditional bioinformatic pipelines for eDNA analysis, such as those implemented in QIIME2, DADA2, or mothur, rely heavily on sequence alignment or mapping to these databases, which is inadequate for novel or divergent deep-sea taxa. This dependency limits the discovery of new species and hinders accurate biodiversity assessments, critical for conservation in rapidly changing deep-sea environments. The computational time required for processing eDNA data exacerbates these challenges, particularly given the limitations of database-dependent methods and the complexity of eDNA datasets.Expected SolutionTo address the challenges of poor database representation and computational time in deep-sea eDNA analysis, we propose anAI-driven pipelinethat uses deep learning and unsupervised learning to identify eukaryotic taxa and assess biodiversity directly from raw eDNA reads. The solution should be able to classify the sequences, annotate and estimate abundance. This solution minimizes reliance on reference databases, reduces computational time through optimized workflows, and enables the discovery of novel taxa and ecological insights in deep-sea ecosystems.OrganizationMinistry of Earth Sciences (MoES)DepartmentCentre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE)CategorySoftwareThemeMiscellaneousYoutube LinkDataset Linkhttps://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/Contact info",

This dependency limits the discovery of new species and hinders accurate biodiversity assessments, critical for conservation in rapidly changing deep-sea environments. The computational time required for processing eDNA data exacerbates these challenges, particularly given the limitations of database-dependent methods and the complexity of eDNA datasets.Expected SolutionTo address the challenges of poor database representation and computational time in deep-sea eDNA analysis, we propose anAI-driven pipelinethat uses deep learning and unsupervised learning to identify eukaryotic taxa and assess biodiversity directly from raw eDNA reads. The solution should be able to classify the sequences, annotate and estimate abundance. This solution minimizes reliance on reference databases, reduces computational time through optimized workflows, and enables the discovery of novel taxa and ecological insights in deep-sea ecosystems.",

In such structures, onions are exposed to extreme temperatures and relative humidity, which reduces the shelf life of onions and high storage loss. Improved onion storage technology will help in ensuring the availability of onions between seasons and obviate seasonal volatility in prices. The solutions could be in the form of improved, but cost-effective, materials and design of storage structures to manage temperature and relative humidity.DescriptionOnion is a semi-perishable vegetable and is harvested during the rabi season, accounting for 65% of onion production, and hits the markets from April to May. The same crop must continue to meet the consumer demand till the month of October-November every year, before the kharif crop is harvested and brought to the market. It is therefore vital to store onions successfully in order to meet the regular supply. It is observed that nearly 30-40% of the crop is lost during storage due to various reasons in form of physiological weight loss, rotting, sprouting etc. In unexpected situations such as natural calamities, the losses even go beyond 50% creating heavy stress both on the demand and supply sides. The losses that occurred during storage are in terms of qualitative as well as in quantitative ways. Hence, it is imperative to take some crucial steps pertaining to onion storage with minimum losses to ensure an adequate supply to the market, thereby reducing the price fluctuations.Various abiotic factors like temperature, relative humidity affect the health of onions; hence, their balance is essential to store the crop with minimum losses. Recent technological advancements (such as Design, Solar/Plasma/Irradiation energy, Nanotechnology, IoT including AI/ML) also offer an opportunity to provide infrastructure for onion storage and supply chain, besides value addition, even in rural India. Design innovations are pervading various sectors, including efficient onion storage at the farm level, rural as well as urban markets.

The cable sample is manually cut by the operator and then straightened manually. Subsequently, these straightened PVC/XLPE/HDPE cable samples are cut into slices using electrically/pneumatically operated machines. Further, the samples are shaped as dumbbells by a dumbbell cutting machine. These manual and semi-automated steps are time-consuming, prone to human error, and introduce inconsistencies that compromise the accuracy and repeatability of critical test results.Detailed DescriptionThis project develops an automated machine designed to precisely cut insulation and outer sheaths from cables, preparing specimens that strictly adhere to the aforementioned IS standards. Key features include an Automated Cable Feeding and Clamping System utilizing motor-driven rollers and adjustable clamps for secure, straightened cable handling. The Cutting and Stripping Module employs precision blades with programmable depths for clean, circumferential cuts and linear stripping, fulfilling specific length requirements for various tests. An integrated diameter sensor will auto-adjust settings. A Control System (PLC/HMI) manages operations, allows test method selection, monitors status, and provides closed-loop feedback. Automated specimen ejection and waste management further streamline workflow. Robust safety features like enclosed areas and interlocks will protect operators.Expected SolutionThe automated machine will eliminate human error, guaranteeing consistent and repeatable specimen quality while significantly reducing preparation time and costs.

The Indian Standard, IS 1418: 2009 \"Determination of gold in gold bullion, gold alloys and gold jewellery/artefacts - Cupellation (Fire Assay) method\" prescribes the fire assay test method for determining the fineness of gold in gold bullion, alloys, and jewellery/artefacts.The fire assay testing method, though globally accepted and accurate, involves a destructive testing process wherein a sample of 250-500 mg is taken from the item by scrapping, drilling, or cutting. The method may lead to the damage of the article, rendering it unsellable, especially when dealing with a few or single article. However, the gold loss incurred during testing is almost negligible. Additionally, the process emits hazardous substances like lead oxides and nitrous fumes.Further, BIS has also formulated an Indian Standard on method of test using ED-XRF (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence), i.e., IS 18458: 2023 \"Jewellery and precious metals ED-XRF test - Method of test\". This Indian Standard prescribes a non-destructive testing method to verify the fineness of the gold jewellery. However, the use of ED-XRF as a non-destructive method to determine the fineness is only applicable to homogenous gold jewellery. In addition, IS 18458: 2023 also has a provision for determination of fineness of jewellery by destructive testing, which is more suited for non-homogeneous jewellery.There is another Indian Standard developed by BIS, IS 16901: 2022 \"Jewellery and precious metals determination of high purity gold, platinum and palladium - difference method using ICP-OES\". This method uses ICP-OES and is applicable only for high purity gold (999 ppt and above). ICP-OES is also a destructive testing method.India's gold jewellery industry is highly diverse, encompassing various types such as casted jewellery, handmade pieces with soldered joints, hollow and filled jewellery, gold-plated items, and studded ornaments using various jewellery manufacturing techniques. While casted jewellery is relatively homogeneous, the majority-particularly handmade and hollow varieties-are structurally complex and heterogeneous. This variability presents significant challenges in testing and hallmarking.In the existing fire assay testing method, heterogeneity is addressed by melting the sample before testing. This eliminates impurities and ensures homogeneity. Moreover, fire assay being a difference method (based on initial and final weight of gold sample), the impact of heterogeneity is nullified. However, owing to its destructive nature, there is strong demand for an alternative non-destructive testing method.Expected Solution:a. Develop and implement anon-destructive assaying methodthat matches the accuracy of fire assay without damaging the jewellery, while being capable of handling heterogeneous compositions (solders, fillers, non-metallic substances).b. Eliminate emissions of harmful substances (lead oxide, nitrous fumes).c. Achieve repeatability close to that of fire assay, ideally within ±0.5 ppt (as per IS 1418).d.

However, tampering with such instruments, especially digital weighing scales, fuel dispensers, water/electricity meters, and retail POS systems-leads to fraudulent trade practices, losses to consumers, and damage to the integrity of commerce.\nTampering may involve unauthorized hardware modifications, altered firmware, embedded malware, hidden switches, or even remote-control manipulation. These alterations are designed to evade detection by regulators while enabling cheating during operation.Problem DescriptionDevelop a robust and intelligent system to detect, prevent, and alert against tampering in weighing and measuring instruments. The system must be capable of identifying both physical and digital tampering attempts in real time or near-real time.

Around 24% was dumped in landfills and 22% remained unaccounted due to leakages in the waste management chain. This unaccounted waste is often burned or disposed of in open areas, drains, or water bodies, posing severe environmental and public health risks. (CEEW, 2025) This calls for strict solutions to enable all the waste generators to contribute to Waste Management.DescriptionOverview: According to the CPCB’s Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Annual Report for 2021-22, India generates approximately 1,70,339 tonnes of waste per day (TPD). Of this, around 1,56,449 TPD is collected. Out of the collected waste, 91,511 TPD is treated, while 41,455 TPD is disposed of in landfills. This leaves a significant gap of 37,373 TPD in effective waste management.Waste treatment: The total waste processed/treated across the country is 91,511 TPD. When compared to the total waste generated, which is 1,70,339 TPD, it is found that an average of 54% of the waste is treated/processed across the country.Solid Waste Processing Facilities: A total of 249 Waste-to-Energy plants, 819 Biomass Power plants and 50.8 lakhs small Biogas plants have been set up in the country to generate Power/Biogas/BioCNG.Expected SolutionsThe proposals aim to develop a strict system to ensure that every citizen is trained on waste management, waste workers get strict training and required safety gear, waste management facilities are present in every ULB/GP, and a dedicated decentralised monitoring system is in place. The solutions are as follows:1. Mandatory training for every citizen: Similar to countries where military training is mandatory for every citizen, in India, there shall be mandatory Waste Management training for every Waste Generator/Citizen. This will ensure source segregation, which will result in better waste management, lesser load on waste management facilities and landfills.i. Physical training on types of waste, source segregation, how to make compost at home, re-use of plastic, etc.ii. Distribution of 3 types of dustbins for dry, wet and domestic hazardous waste to every household/citizen.iii. Distribution of a designed and tested compost making kit to every household/citizen.iv.

Aspiring athletes, particularly from rural and remote areas, often lack access to standardized assessment facilities or opportunities to showcase their talent. The absence of reliable and scalable talent assessment models hinders the discovery of potential athletes who could benefit from Government support. A set of standard fitness assessment tests - including height, weight, vertical jump, shuttle run, sit-ups, and endurance runs (Annexure A) - provides a scientific method to evaluate talent. However, the reach and implementation of such tests remain limited due to infrastructure constraints.Problem DescriptionThe Sports Authority of India (SAI) requires an innovative, mobile-based solution to democratize sports talent assessment. The proposed platform should:1. Enable athletes to download an app and record videos of their performance in the prescribed fitness assessment tests.2. Use AI/ML-based on-device verification to analyze the recorded videos for accuracy and authenticity (e.g., detecting jump height, counting sit-ups, or measuring time/distance in runs).3. Securely submit verified data to SAI servers for further evaluation and athlete profiling.4. Be low-cost and lightweight, ensuring accessibility even on entry-level smartphones and low-bandwidth networks.Innovative Features1. AI-based Cheat Detection: Identify anomalies or manipulations (e.g., tampered videos or incorrect movements) to ensure fair assessments.2. Offline Video Analysis: Perform preliminary performance analysis directly on the device without requiring continuous internet connectivity.3. Performance Benchmarking: Compare athlete performance against age/gender-based benchmarks, providing instant feedback.4. Gamified User Interface: Use progress badges, leaderboards, and interactive visuals to engage athletes and encourage participation.5. Auto-Test Segmentation: Automatically detect and segment performance clips (e.g., counting reps in sit-ups or analyzing vertical jumps) to reduce manual effort.Expected Deliverables1. A mobile application (Android/iOS) that allows video recording and assessment of athletes performance across the test batteries.2.

Every business day the organization generates and receives thousands of pages of material: engineering drawings, maintenance job cards, incident reports, vendor invoices, purchase-order correspondence, regulatory directives, environmental-impact studies, safety circulars, HR policies, legal opinions, and board-meeting minutes. These arrive through e-mail, Maximo exports, SharePoint repositories, WhatsApp PDFs, hard-copy scans, and ad-hoc cloud links—often in both English and Malayalam, sometimes in bilingual hybrids, frequently with embedded tables, photos, or signatures. The sheer diversity and volume have created a silent productivity tax: \n● Information latency: Front-line managers spend hours skimming lengthy documents for the few actionable lines that affect their shift, delaying decisions on train availability, contractor payments, or staffing reallocations. \n● Siloed awareness: Procurement may negotiate a spare-parts contract without realizing that Engineering has already flagged an upcoming design change HR may schedule refresher training unaware of a new safety bulletin released the previous evening.\n● Compliance exposure: Regulatory updates from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety and the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs are buried in inboxes, risking missed deadlines or audit non-conformities. \n● Knowledge attrition: Institutional memory remains locked in static files when key personnel transfer or retire, hard-won insights vanish with them. \n● Duplicated effort: Different teams independently create summaries or slide decks of the same source documents, multiplying manual work and version-control headaches. \n\nAs KMRL prepares to expand its corridor, add two new depots, and integrate emerging technologies such as Unified Namespace (UNS) data streams and IoT condition monitoring, the documentary burden will only intensify. Without an organization-wide mechanism to condense, contextualize, and route critical information, the metro risks slower decision cycles, avoidable operating costs, diminished service reliability, and heightened safety and legal vulnerabilities. The challenge, therefore, is to equip every stakeholder—from station controllers and rolling-stock engineers to finance officers and executive directors—with rapid, trustworthy snapshots of the documents that matter to them, while preserving traceability to the original source.

The decision hinges on six inter-dependent variables: \n1. Fitness Certificates – validity windows issued by Rolling-Stock, Signalling and Telecom departments.\n2. Job-Card Status – open vs. closed work orders exported from IBM Maximo. \n3. Branding Priorities – contractual commitments that dictate exterior wrap exposure hours. \n4. Mileage Balancing – kilometre allocation to equalise bogie, brake-pad and HVAC wear. \n5. Cleaning & Detailing Slots – available manpower and bay occupancy for interior deep-cleaning. \n6. Stabling Geometry – physical bay positions that minimise nightly shunting and morning turn-out time. \nAt present these data points reside in siloed spreadsheets, manual logbooks, and daily WhatsApp updates. Supervisors reconcile them in a time-compressed window (21:00–23:00 IST) using ad-hoc filters and experience-based heuristics. The process is opaque, non-repeatable, and highly error-prone:\n● Missing a single telecom clearance can force an unscheduled rake withdrawal, eroding the 99.5 % punctuality KPI. \n● Uneven mileage assignment accelerates component fatigue, inflating maintenance cost. \n● Inadequate visibility into branding priorities risks breaching advertiser SLAs, exposing KMRL to revenue penalties. \n● Excessive night-time shunting to rearrange rakes increases energy consumption and track-occupancy safety risk. With fleet size slated to grow to 40 trainsets and two depots by 2027, the existing manual workflow cannot scale linearly—neither in staffing nor in cognitive load. Therefore, KMRL requires an integrated, algorithm-driven decision-support platform that can: \n● Ingest heterogeneous inputs (Maximo exports, IoT fitness sensors, UNS streams, manual overrides) in near-real-time. \n● Enforce rule-based constraints and multi-objective optimisation (service readiness, reliability, cost, branding exposure). \n● Generate a ranked induction list with explainable reasoning, conflict alerts, and “what-if” simulation. \n● Learn from historical outcomes via machine-learning feedback loops to improve forecast accuracy over time. \nSuch a system will transform induction planning from a manual reconciliation exercise into a reproducible, auditable, data-driven process—delivering higher fleet availability, lower lifecycle cost, and an enhanced passenger experience while freeing operations staff to focus on strategic exceptions rather than routine data wrangling.OrganizationGovernment of KeralaDepartmentKochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL)CategorySoftwareThemeSmart AutomationYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",

At the heart of the problem lies a critical gap in awareness, most students and often their parents do not understand the importance of graduation, what career opportunities different degree courses unlock, or how to choose a subject stream based on personal interest and future prospects. After passing Class 10 or 12, students face confusion about:- Which subject stream (Arts, Science, Commerce) to opt for.- What kind of degree programs are available in nearby government colleges.- What jobs or higher studies they can pursue after choosing a particular course.- Whether pursuing graduation is even worth the effort, especially when short-term job or skill-based courses seem more accessible.This lack of clarity leads to poor academic decisions, dropouts, or migration to private institutions that often promise but fail to deliver quality education.DescriptionThe above problem statement envisages that a customized Digital Guidance Platform for students should be developed as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor.Key Features of the App/Web Platform:-Aptitude & Interest-Based Course Suggestion:Short quizzes to assess the student's interests, strengths and personality traits. Based on results, the app will suggest suitable streams and subjects (Arts, Science, Commerce, Vocational). Students can compare career paths based on different combinations.-Course-to-Career Path Mapping:Detailed visual charts showing what each degree (B.A., B.Sc., B.Com., BBA, etc.) offers. The industries or sectors each course leads to and relevant government exams, private jobs, entrepreneurial options, or higher education available after each stream.-Nearby Government Colleges Directory:Location-based listing of government colleges, information on available degree programs; cut-offs and eligibility, medium of instruction, facilities (hostel, lab, library, internet access).-Timeline Tracker:Notification system for admission dates, scholarship application windows, college entrance tests or counseling schedules.-Customization and Personalization:User profiles created at login — tracking age, gender, class, academic interests. AI-driven recommendation engine suggests:• Courses to apply for.• Colleges nearby.• Career paths aligned with their aptitude.• Study materials tailored to subject choice.Implementation Strategy-Stakeholder Collaboration:Involve government education departments, school teachers, NGOs, and counselors for content and outreach.-Technology Development:Partner with EdTech developers to build a scalable, lightweight app with offline features for poor internet areas.-Pilot Launch:Start in one or two districts with low college enrollment. Get feedback from students and teachers.-Full-Scale Rollout:Roll out state-wide or nationally through government schools and skill centers.-Monitoring & Feedback:Real-time analytics to track usage, app suggestions, successful transitions to college enrollment.Expected SolutionWe propose the development of a mobile + web-based application that acts as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor. The platform will be designed for students guiding them in choosing the right subject combination after class 12th, selecting suitable degree courses in local government colleges, understanding the long-term outcomes of different courses (jobs, entrance exams, skill development) and accessing open-source e-books, skill materials, and scholarships.Impact- Improved enrollment in government degree colleges by helping students make informed academic decisions.- Reduced dropouts after Class 10 and 12.- Empowered students with access to reliable, localized career guidance.- Stronger perception of government colleges as viable career-building institutions.OrganizationGovernment of Jammu and KashmirDepartmentHigher Education DepartmentCategorySoftwareThemeSmart EducationYoutube Linkhttps://youtu.be/YNZt9WnEjfM?feature=sharedDataset LinkContact info",

Students can compare career paths based on different combinations.-Course-to-Career Path Mapping:Detailed visual charts showing what each degree (B.A., B.Sc., B.Com., BBA, etc.) offers. The industries or sectors each course leads to and relevant government exams, private jobs, entrepreneurial options, or higher education available after each stream.-Nearby Government Colleges Directory:Location-based listing of government colleges, information on available degree programs; cut-offs and eligibility, medium of instruction, facilities (hostel, lab, library, internet access).-Timeline Tracker:Notification system for admission dates, scholarship application windows, college entrance tests or counseling schedules.-Customization and Personalization:User profiles created at login — tracking age, gender, class, academic interests. AI-driven recommendation engine suggests:• Courses to apply for.• Colleges nearby.• Career paths aligned with their aptitude.• Study materials tailored to subject choice.Implementation Strategy-Stakeholder Collaboration:Involve government education departments, school teachers, NGOs, and counselors for content and outreach.-Technology Development:Partner with EdTech developers to build a scalable, lightweight app with offline features for poor internet areas.-Pilot Launch:Start in one or two districts with low college enrollment. Get feedback from students and teachers.-Full-Scale Rollout:Roll out state-wide or nationally through government schools and skill centers.-Monitoring & Feedback:Real-time analytics to track usage, app suggestions, successful transitions to college enrollment.Expected SolutionWe propose the development of a mobile + web-based application that acts as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor. The platform will be designed for students guiding them in choosing the right subject combination after class 12th, selecting suitable degree courses in local government colleges, understanding the long-term outcomes of different courses (jobs, entrance exams, skill development) and accessing open-source e-books, skill materials, and scholarships.Impact- Improved enrollment in government degree colleges by helping students make informed academic decisions.- Reduced dropouts after Class 10 and 12.- Empowered students with access to reliable, localized career guidance.- Stronger perception of government colleges as viable career-building institutions.",

      "25004": "BackgroundThe Government of India is implementing the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA) for systematic data recording of breeding, health, and nutrition of dairy animals. Field Level Workers (FLWs) are responsible for capturing animal data on the ground. However, despite multiple training programs, a recurring issue is the incorrect identification and registration of animal breeds of cattle and buffaloes. This misclassification significantly affects the integrity and usability of the data for research, policy planning, and targeted interventions.DescriptionBreed identification errors in BPA often arise due to manual judgment and lack of breed-specific awareness among FLWs. India, being home to a diverse array of indigenous and crossbred cattle and buffalo breeds, presents a complex challenge for accurate breed identification. Incorrect entries compromise the value of collected data and, in turn, impact the effectiveness of genetic improvement, nutrition planning, disease control, and overall program outcomes.To address this, an AI-driven solution that can identify the breed of an animal using its image can prove extremely valuable. By using image recognition and machine learning techniques, the software can standardize breed identification and minimize manual errors. If successfully developed and validated, such a system can be integrated with the BPA to act as a decision-support tool for FLWs during registration.Expected Solution• Uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image analysis to recognize and classify the breed of cattle and buffaloes based on images.• Can handle diverse environmental backgrounds, lighting conditions, and varying animal poses.• Maintains a breed database (for the most common Indian cattle and buffalo breeds and their crosses).• Provides breed suggestions or confirmations at the time of registration in BPA.• Can be seamlessly integrated with the BPA platform to support real-time validation or correction of breed entries.• Includes a user-friendly interface for FLWs with minimal technical training requirements."

      "Problem Statement ID": "Description",
      "25005": "Background:In dairy farming, evaluating the body structure of animals is vital to predict their longevity, productivity, and reproductive efficiency. Traditionally, Animal Type Classification (ATC)—which involves scoring animals for physical traits—is conducted by trained personnel through visual inspection and manual measurement of specific body parts. However, this manual method is prone to human error and subjectivity, even with trained professionals, resulting in inconsistent and potentially unreliable data.With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image processing technologies, there is an opportunity to automate this process. Automated scoring based on images can ensure standardization, minimize observer bias, and improve the reliability of data captured for scientific and breeding purposes.Description:The Government of India is implementing the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) since December 2014, aiming to conserve and develop indigenous bovine breeds, genetically upgrade the bovine population, and enhance milk productivity. Under this mission, Progeny Testing (PT) and Pedigree Selection (PS) programs are being carried out in key dairy breeds across the country to produce high genetic merit bulls for breeding purposes.Animal Type Classification (ATC) is a crucial step in identifying top-performing elite dams, which are potential mothers of future breeding bulls. Currently, ATC is performed manually by a trained Animal Typer who visually examines and measures physical traits, and then records the scores in the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA). Despite training, errors due to fatigue, bias, or measurement inaccuracies can adversely affect data quality and scientific analysis.There is a need for an AI-driven solution that can automate this classification process by analyzing animal images, extracting body structure parameters, and assigning standardized scores with minimal human intervention. If integrated with BPA, such a solution would enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scientific validity of animal evaluation under PT and PS programs.Expected Solution:Students are expected to develop an AI-based Auto Recording of Animal Type Classification System that can:Use images of cattle and buffaloes to evaluate physical traits relevant to Animal Type Classification.Extract and quantify specific body structure parameters (e.g., body length, height at withers, chest width, rump angle, etc.) using AI and image processing techniques.Generate objective and consistent classification scores.Auto-record and store the classification data in a structured format.Provide seamless integration with BPA to auto-save the classification records at the time of evaluation.Be user-friendly and operable by field personnel with minimal technical skills."

      "Problem Statement ID": "Description",
      "25022": "BackgroundIndian Railways manages train movements primarily through the experience of train traffic controllers. While effective, this manual approach faces limitations as network congestion and operational complexity grow. Trains of varying types and priorities must share limited track infrastructure across space and time, making optimal allocation a significant challenge. The problem is a large-scale combinatorial optimization task with numerous constraints such as safety, track resources, system of working, signalling system, platform availability, train schedules, and train priorities. As real-time decisions become increasingly complex, there is a growing need for intelligent, data-driven systems powered by optimization algorithms and AI to enhance efficiency, punctuality, and utilization of railway infrastructure.Detailed DescriptionCurrently, experienced traffic controllers oversee operations and take real-time decisions—whether a train should proceed, halt, or be rerouted—based on operational conditions and institutional knowledge. With rising traffic volumes and higher expectations for punctuality, safety, and efficiency, manual decision-making alone is becoming insufficient.The network is constrained by finite infrastructure—limited track sections, junctions, crossings, and platform capacities—shared by long-distance express, suburban local, freight, maintenance blocks, and unscheduled specials. Coordinating these movements across spatial (network layout) and temporal (scheduling) dimensions while maintaining safety and minimizing delays is formidable.Within a section managed by a section controller, the core problem is to decide train precedence and crossings to maximize throughput and minimize overall train travel time, considering section characteristics (e.g., line capacity, gradients, signal placements) and varying train priorities. This represents a dynamic, large-scale combinatorial optimization problem with an exponentially large solution space, further complicated by real-time disruptions (breakdowns, weather, rolling stock delays). Human intuition alone is no longer sufficient; intelligent decision-support tools are required to improve precision, scalability, and responsiveness.Expected SolutionAn intelligent decision-support system that assists section controllers in making optimized, real-time decisions for train precedence and crossings. The system should:• Leverage operations research and AI to model constraints, train priorities, and operational rules, producing conflict-free, feasible schedules dynamically.• Maximize section throughput and minimize overall train travel time, with the ability to re-optimize rapidly under disruptions (e.g., incidents, delays, weather).• Support what-if simulation and scenario analysis to evaluate alternative routings, holding strategies, and platform allocations.• Provide a user-friendly interface for controllers with clear recommendations, explanations, and override capabilities.• Integrate with existing railway control systems and data sources (signalling, TMS, timetables, rolling stock status) via secure APIs.• Include audit trails, performance dashboards, and KPIs (punctuality, average delay, throughput, utilization) for continuous improvement."

      "25025": "BackgroundIn Ayurveda and other traditional medicine systems,Rasa (taste)is a fundamental criterion for identifying, classifying, and determining the therapeutic value of medicinal herbs. While this taste-based assessment has been effective for centuries, it is inherently subjective, relying on human perception and expert experience, which often leads to variability and inconsistency.In the modern context, ensuring the authenticity, quality, and standardization of herbal raw materials is a critical challenge due to widespread adulteration, batch-to-batch phytochemical variations, and the global demand for reliable herbal products.Recent advances insensor scienceandanalytical technologiesprovide innovative solutions to these challenges.Electronic tongue (e-tongue)systems can mimic human gustatory mechanisms by detecting complex chemical signatures, while spectroscopic techniques such asNear-Infrared (NIR), Raman,andUV-Visible spectroscopyoffer rapid, non-destructive chemical profiling of herbal samples.When integrated withArtificial Intelligence (AI)andMachine Learning (ML)—such as chemometric modelling, neural networks, and pattern recognition—large datasets can be analyzed to classify herbs based on taste profiles, threshold levels, and phytochemical composition with high precision. ThisAI-enabled, sensor-integrated approachensures faster, objective, and cost-effective quality assurance, bridging traditional Ayurvedic principles with modern scientific validation.Detailed DescriptionThe problem statement aims to design and develop asensor-integrated AI-enabled devicefor objective quality assessment of marketed herbal samples. The device will incorporate:• A multi-sensor e-tongue array to detect basic taste modalities (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, astringent).• A threshold detection module for quantifying the minimum perceptible concentration of each taste-related compound.• Analytical integration with phytochemical profiling techniques (e.g., HPTLC, FTIR, LC-MS) for correlating taste signatures with chemical constituents.Expected Solution• A portable hardware prototype incorporating an electronic tongue (e-tongue) sensor array.• Calibration using authenticated herb samples and machine learning models trained on large datasets of taste and phytochemical fingerprints.• Smart alerts and decision support for detecting adulteration or substandard quality.• A centralized or cloud-compatible database that updates continuously with new samples and learning outputs.• Applicability across industries including Ayurvedic pharmacopeia standardization, herbal industry quality control, academic research, and regulatory bodies."

      "25026": "BackgroundIndia’s Ayush sector is rapidly transitioning from paper-based records to interoperable digital health systems. Central to this transformation are two key coding systems: the National AYUSH Morbidity & Standardized Terminologies Electronic (NAMASTE) codes, which provide over 4,500 standardized terms for Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani disorders, WHO Standardised International Terminologies for Ayurveda and the WHO’s ICD-11, Chapter – 26, Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2), which integrates 529 disorder categories and 196 pattern codes into the global ICD framework. Harmonising these vocabularies within Electronic Medical Record (EMR) platforms not only enables accurate clinical documentation and decision support but also ensures compliance with India’s 2016 EHR Standards—mandating FHIR R4 APIs, SNOMED CT and LOINC semantics, ISO 22600 access control, ABHA-linked OAuth 2.0 authentication, and robust audit trails for consent and versioning.To operationalize this dual-coding approach, EMR vendors must implement a lightweight terminology micro-service that ingests NAMASTE CSV and synchronises with the WHO-11 ICD-API (Including Biomedicine and TM2). Within the EMR user interface, diagnosis entries should support auto-complete widgets that return both NAMASTE and ICD-11 (TM2 and Biomedicine) codes, comply with the Coding rules of ICD-11 framework and store them together in the patient’s Problem List resource. This integration empowers clinicians to combine traditional and biomedical insights, facilitates Ayush insurance claims under global ICD-11 coding rules, and provides the Ministry of Ayush with real-time morbidity analytics aligned with national and international reporting standards.DescriptionDesign and prototype an API integration that brings India’s NAMASTE terminologies, WHO Standardised International terminology and the WHO ICD-11 (Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2) & Biomedicine) into a FHIR-compliant Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. Your goal is to enable clinicians to record traditional medicine diagnoses (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani) using NAMASTE codes, then automatically map them to global ICD-11 (TM2 and Biomedicine) identifiers—supporting dual/double-coding (One code denoting Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani (TM) and another denoting Biomedicine) for interoperability, analytics and insurance claims.Your deliverable is a lightweight micro-service or FHIR terminology plugin offering:• A FHIR compliant resource for NAMASTE codes linking to WHO International Terminologies of Ayurveda, ICD-11 (TM2 and Biomedicine) and compliant with ICD-11 Coding rules.• A REST endpoint for auto-complete value-set lookup.• A translation operation converting NAMASTE ↔ TM2 codes.• An encounter upload endpoint that ingests FHIR Bundles with both code systems.• OAuth 2.0–secured access using ABHA tokens and audit-ready metadata.Teams should demonstrate1.

    },
    {
      "Problem Statement ID": "Description",
      "25027": "BackgroundThe Ayurvedic herbal supply chain in India is characterised by fragmented networks of smallholder farmers, wild collectors and multiple intermediaries, leading to challenges in ensuring consistent quality, authenticity and sustainable sourcing of medicinal plants. Variations in harvesting practices, environmental conditions and manual record-keeping introduce risks of mislabeling, adulteration and over-harvesting of vulnerable species, undermining consumer trust and compliance with regulatory standards. Geographic provenance is often undocumented or opaque, making it difficult for manufacturers and regulators to verify that herbs originate from approved regions or follow sustainable collection guidelines.A blockchain-based traceability system, augmented with geo-tagging technology, can address these gaps by creating an immutable, decentralised ledger that records every step of the herb's journey—from on-site GPS-tagged collection events through processing, testing and formulation. Smart contracts on a permissioned network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) can enforce sustainability criteria and automate quality validations, while IoT-enabled devices capture real-time location and environmental data at remote collection points, even via SMS-over-blockchain gateways where connectivity is sparse. By integrating FHIR-style metadata bundles (e.g., \"CollectionEvent,\" \"QualityTest,\" \"ProcessingStep\") and QR-code scanning at aggregation nodes, stakeholders gain end-to-end visibility, enabling rapid verification of provenance, streamlined certification for export and robust audit trails to support both biodiversity conservation and supply-chain efficiency. When herbs are formulated into finished products, unique, serialised QR codes generated by the blockchain platform could be affixed to each package. End customers scan these codes with a mobile app or web portal—powered by the same blockchain ledger—to retrieve a FHIR-style provenance bundle detailing each upstream event: farm of origin, harvest conditions, intermediary custody, laboratory certificates and batch formulation parameters. This consumer-facing transparency not only verifies authenticity and builds trust, but also supports ethical marketing, enables rapid recall management and fosters incentives for sustainable collection practices by linking premium pricing to verified harvest data. Over time, analytics on consumer scans can feed back into demand forecasting, closing the loop between consumer assurance and supply-chain optimisation.DescriptionA permissioned blockchain network will immutably record every stage of an Ayurvedic herb's journey—from geo-tagged harvest events by farmers or wild collectors, through multi-stage processing and laboratory testing, to the finished product on retail shelves. At the point of collection, GPS-enabled mobile or IoT devices capture precise location, timestamp, collector identity, species identification and initial quality metrics as a \"Collection Event.\" Subsequent \"Processing Step\" and \"Quality Test\" events—each embedding standardised metadata bundles—are added by processing facilities and testing laboratories. Smart contracts enforce National Medicinal Plants Board sustainability guidelines and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices by automatically validating geo-fencing rules, seasonal restrictions and quality thresholds before committing each transaction to the ledger.When formulation is complete, unique QR codes generated on-chain are affixed to product packaging. End customers scan these codes via a lightweight web or mobile portal (no specialised app required) to retrieve the full provenance record: farm coordinates and harvest conditions; chain-of-custody handoffs; lab certificates for moisture, pesticide and DNA-barcode tests; and sustainability and fair-trade compliance proofs. This consumer-facing transparency assures authenticity and safety, enables rapid recall notifications for affected batches and tells the story of each product—complete with interactive maps and farmer or community profiles. By combining tamper-proof audit trails, geo-tagged traceability and automated compliance enforcement, the system delivers a replicable model for ethical, sustainable and trust-driven Ayurvedic herb sourcing.Expected SolutionParticipants will deliver a proof-of-concept blockchain-based botanical traceability system addressing end-to-end provenance of Ayurvedic herbs. The solution should include the following core components and capabilities:1. Permissioned Blockchain Network• A lightweight, permissioned ledger (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric or Corda) that records every supply-chain transaction.• Network nodes representing farmers' cooperatives, wild-collector groups, testing laboratories, processing facilities and manufacturers.• Smart contracts enforcing:- Geo-fencing rules based on collectors' GPS coordinates and approved harvesting zones.- Seasonal-harvest restrictions and species-specific conservation limits per National Medicinal Plants Board guidelines.- Quality-gate validations (e.g., moisture thresholds, pesticide limits, DNA barcoding checks).2. Geo-Tagged Data Capture• IoT/GPS-enabled mobile DApp (or SMS-over-blockchain gateway) for collectors to record \"CollectionEvent\" metadata: latitude/longitude, timestamp, collector ID, species and initial quality metrics.• Sensor integrations or manual interfaces for \"QualityTest\" events (lab results) and \"ProcessingStep\" events (drying, grinding, storage conditions).3. Smart Labeling & Consumer Portal• On-chain generation of unique QR codes for each finished product batch.• A lightweight web/mobile portal (no specialised install required) allowing end customers to scan QR codes and retrieve a complete FHIR-style provenance bundle:- Collection location map and harvest details- Chain-of-custody handoffs through each supply-chain node- Laboratory certificates for moisture, pesticide analysis, DNA authentication- Sustainability compliance proofs and fair-trade verifications- Interactive farmer/community profiles and conservation credentials4. Integration & Interoperability• RESTful APIs for supply-chain managers to query real-time dashboards of harvest volumes, batch statuses, QA results and sustainability metrics.• Plugins or connectors to existing ERP/quality-management systems for seamless data exchange.• Use of FHIR-style resource models (CollectionEvent, QualityTest, ProcessingStep, Provenance) for standardized metadata exchange.5. User Interfaces & Reporting• A mobile DApp interface optimized for low-bandwidth rural environments, with offline data capture and SMS synchronization.• A web dashboard for stakeholders to monitor network health, query provenance records and generate compliance reports aligned with AYUSH Ministry export and sustainability requirements.• Automated reporting modules that compile environmental-impact metrics and conservation compliance data for certification bodies.6. Demonstration & Evaluation• A live pilot using one botanical species (e.g., Ashwagandha) across a small farming cooperative and a collaborating processor.• End-to-end demonstration: geo-tagging harvest, adding lab results, processing events, QR code scanning by simulated consumers and recall simulation.• Metrics collection on data-capture latency, transaction throughput, offline sync reliability and consumer-scan engagement.By delivering these elements, participants will showcase a replicable, transparent and sustainable model for botanical traceability that bridges traditional Ayurvedic sourcing with modern blockchain technology and consumer empowerment."

Cases of fraudulent documents being used for jobs, admissions, or government schemes have highlighted the absence of a robust mechanism to verify the authenticity of educational credentials issued by colleges and universities.At present, verification is often manual, relying on physical inspection, emails to institutions, or outdated databases. This creates delays, inconsistency, and susceptibility to corruption or manipulation. To preserve academic integrity and public trust, there is a pressing need for an efficient, secure, and scalable digital system to detect and prevent the use of fake degrees.Detailed DescriptionThe challenge is to create a digital platform that can authenticate and detect fake degrees or certificates issued by higher education institutions across Jharkhand. The system should be able to cross-verify uploaded documents (PDFs, scans, etc.) with institutional databases or credential registries, using metadata, QR codes, signatures, or embedded hashes.Such a platform must work with both legacy certificates (issued before digitization) and new ones generated under university ERP systems. It should detect anomalies such as:- Tampered grades or photos- Forged seals or signatures- Invalid certificate numbers- Non-existent institutions or courses- Duplicate or cloned documentsIncorporating AI, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and blockchain or cryptographic validation, the platform should enable seamless certificate verification by employers, admission offices, scholarship agencies, and government departments. The goal is to create a trustable and publicly accessible system that protects institutions’ reputation and safeguards student achievements.Expected SolutionA smart, scalable, and secure Fake Degree/Certificate Recognition system that includes:• Upload interface for verifying entities (employers, institutions, agencies) to upload or input certificate details• Certificate authenticity checker that:– Uses OCR to extract key details (name, roll number, marks, certificate ID)– Matches it against a verified database (centralized or decentralized)– Flags mismatches or formatting inconsistencies• Digital watermark or blockchain verification support for newly issued certificates• Institution integration module for universities/colleges to upload their certificate records in bulk or in real-time• Admin dashboard for authorized bodies (e.g., Higher Education Department) to monitor verification activity, detect forgery trends, and blacklist offenders• Alert system for invalid or forged entries• Data privacy and access control measures to ensure secure handling of student informationThis solution must be adaptable across different institutions, work with both physical and digital certificates, and be affordable for state-wide rollout."

However, despite its vast potential, the state's tourism industry remains underdeveloped due to a lack of digital infrastructure, limited promotional outreach, low tourist awareness, and unorganized travel and hospitality services.DescriptionTourists often find it difficult to access reliable information about destinations, local transportation, accommodations, cultural activities, and guides. Additionally, local artisans, tribal communities, and small-scale service providers who could benefit greatly from tourism remain largely excluded from the digital ecosystem. There is a strong need for a centralized digital platform that not only improves the tourist experience through authentic and accessible information but also connects and empowers local communities, making tourism in Jharkhand more inclusive, organized, and sustainable.Expected SolutionDesign and develop an AI-powered digital tourism platform (mobile app and/or website) for Jharkhand that offers:• AI-based personalized itinerary planning and multilingual chatbot assistance for tourists.• Blockchain-enabled secure transactions, guide verification, and digital certification for local service providers.• Interactive maps and AR/VR previews of major tourist and cultural sites.• Real-time transport and location info using geo-location.• Integrated local marketplace for tribal handicrafts, events, homestays, and ecotourism.• AI-driven feedback and sentiment analysis for continuous improvement.• Analytics dashboard for tourism officials to monitor trends and impact."

In instances where a substantial volume of comments is received on draft legislation, there exists a risk of certain observations being inadvertently overlooked or inadequately analysed. In order to review each individual submission, leveraging AI-assisted tools will help ensure that all remarks are duly considered and systematically analysed. Requirement is the development of an AI model aimed at predicting the sentiments of the suggestions provided by stakeholders in the eConsultation module. It should also generate a visual representation in the form of a word cloud, highlighting the keywords utilised by the stakeholders within their suggestions.Expected OutcomeThe intention is to discern the feedback received from the stakeholders through the following:• Sentiment analysis• Summary generation• Word cloudThe solution should considerably reduce the effort of the end user in analysing a high volume of comments. It should be able to clearly identify the sentiments of comments individually as well as broadly overall. The summary generation should be accurate and convey the meaning of the comment properly, in a precise manner. The word cloud feature should showcase the density of the words used by all users."

      "Problem Statement ID": "Description",
      "25036": "BackgroundMicroplastics — plastic particles less than 5 mm in size — have emerged as a global environmental threat, contaminating oceans, freshwater systems, and even drinking water. These particles originate from the degradation of larger plastics or from microbeads in consumer products. Their persistence and bioaccumulative nature pose serious risks to aquatic life, ecosystems, and potentially human health. Current methods for detecting microplastics — such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy — are often accurate but time-consuming, expensive, and laboratory-dependent, limiting their application for real-time, field-based monitoring.DescriptionThe project aims to develop a low-cost, efficient, and portable sensor capable of detecting microplastics in various water sources. The focus may be on using optical detection techniques — such as light scattering, fluorescence, or absorbance — combined with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition. The sensor may be designed to identify microplastic particles based on their optical signatures, size distribution, and possibly polymer type. Water samples shall pass through a detection chamber, where embedded sensors capture spectral or visual data. This information would be processed in real time, either on-device or via a connected application. The system should be tested using standard microplastic samples (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene) and validated against existing lab-based techniques.Expected SolutionThe expected outcome is a compact, field-deployable sensor system that can detect and quantify microplastics in water samples within minutes. It should offer reasonable sensitivity (down to 10–100 μm), operate on battery or solar power, and require minimal sample preparation. Additionally, the solution may include a companion software interface for data logging, visualization, and analysis. This innovation should have strong potential for adoption in microplastic monitoring, supporting researchers, environmental agencies, and water quality managers in making faster, data-driven decisions for pollution control and mitigation."

      "25037": "BackgroundGrain size is a fundamental property used to classify beach types and plays a critical role in influencing coastal morphodynamic processes. However, measuring grain size is particularly challenging, as it requires scientists to visit each site to collect sediment samples. These samples must then undergo time-consuming physical processing in the laboratory to determine their characteristics. Moreover, because beach sediments are dynamic and constantly changing due to wave action, tides, and weather events, this process must be repeated regularly to maintain accurate and up-to-date data.DescriptionThe above problem statement envisages that a low-cost camera-based automated mapping system be developed to estimate the sediment grain size distribution of the sandy beach area (i.e., berm, intertidal, and dune) and classify the beach category of the measurement region. A low-cost camera-based mapping system, along with automated prediction algorithms, is used to estimate the sediment grain size distribution of a particular area of interest to be developed. Also, this system should incorporate a GNSS/GPS receiver to map the geographic positions of the measurement location.Expected SolutionA low-cost camera-based mapping system with a GNSS/GPS receiver should be developed with an automated image processing algorithm for beach sand grain size estimation/classification. Validation should be performed at least on one sample based on data collected in the area of interest."

Its early warning services cover hazards such as tsunamis, storm surges, high waves, swell surges, and coastal currents, enabling authorities and communities to make informed decisions during ocean-related emergencies.BackgroundIndia’s vast coastline is vulnerable to a range of ocean hazards such as tsunamis, storm surges, high waves, coastal currents, and abnormal sea behaviour. While agencies like INCOIS provide early warnings based on satellite data, sensors, and numerical models; real-time field reporting from citizens and local communities are often unavailable or delayed. Additionally, valuable insights from public discussions on social media during hazard events remain untapped, yet can be critical for understanding ground realities, public awareness, and the spread of information.Detailed DescriptionThere is a need for a unified platform that enables citizens, coastal residents, volunteers, and disaster managers to report observations during hazardous ocean events (e.g., unusual tides, flooding, coastal damage, tsunami, swell surges, high waves, etc.) and to monitor public communication trends via social media.This platform should:• Allow citizens to submit geotagged reports, photos, or videos of observed ocean hazards via a mobile/web app.• Support role-based access for citizens, officials, and analysts.• Aggregate and visualize real-time crowdsourced data on a dynamic dashboard.• Visualize all crowdsourced reports and social media indicators on an interactive map, with hotspots dynamically generated based on report density, keyword frequency, or verified incidents.• Integrate social media feeds (e.g., Twitter, public Facebook posts, YouTube comments) and apply Text Classification/Natural Language Processing to extract hazard-related discussions and trends.• Help emergency response agencies understand the scale, urgency, and sentiment of hazard events.• Provide filters by location, event type, date, and source, enabling better situational awareness and faster validation of warning models.Expected SolutionAn integrated software platform (mobile + web) with:• User registration and reporting interface with media upload.• Map-based dashboard showing live crowd reports and social media activity.• Dynamic hotspot generation based on report volume or verified threat indicators.• Backend database and API for data management and integration with early warning systems.• NLP engine for detecting relevant hazard-related posts, keywords, and engagement metrics.• Multilingual support for regional accessibility.• Offline data collection capabilities (sync later), useful for remote coastal areas."

      "25041": "About CMLRECMLRE, Kochi, an attached office under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, plays a key role in organising and promoting ocean development activities in India, with a focus on mapping, assessing, and managing marine living resources in the Indian EEZ. The Marine Living Resources Programme supports ecosystem-based research and monitoring, aimed at sustainable utilisation of these resources through scientific surveys, environmental studies, and data-driven ecosystem modelling.BackgroundIndia, with its vast coastline and rich marine biodiversity, relies heavily on the health of its ocean ecosystems for food security, climate regulation, and economic development. The Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE), under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, plays a pivotal role in collecting, managing, and analysing a broad spectrum of marine data to support sustainable ocean resource management.Detailed descriptionCMLRE's datasets are diverse, complex, and multidisciplinary, including physical, chemical, and biological oceanography; fish abundance, species diversity, life history traits, and ecomorphology; fish taxonomy and otolith morphology; molecular biology data, including environmental DNA (eDNA) for species detection and biodiversity assessments. These datasets exist across various formats (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured), and are stored in siloed systems, making cross-domain integration, real-time visualization, and advanced analytics nearly impossible. This creates a major bottleneck for marine scientists, conservationists, and policymakers who need to make data-driven decisions for ecosystem conservation and fisheries management.CMLRE seeks an AI-enabled, intelligent digital platform that can integrate heterogeneous and high-volume datasets from oceanography, taxonomy, morphology, and molecular biology into a single unified system. The platform should support automated data ingestion, standardisation, and metadata tagging using internationally accepted formats, enable cross-disciplinary correlation analysis to study how ocean parameters influence biodiversity, fish distribution, and ecosystem health, and incorporate interactive modules for otolith shape and morphometrics visualisation, taxonomic classification and species identification, and molecular and eDNA data storage/retrieval and species matching.Why It MattersThis platform will serve as a national marine data backbone, empowering India's scientific community with a next-generation tool for holistic marine ecosystem assessment. It will improve the efficiency of marine biodiversity research, enhance real-time decision-making, and support blue economy initiatives by enabling sustainable fisheries and conservation planning through integrated data insights.Expected Deliverables• A robust, cloud-ready web platform prototype.• Scalable backend architecture with modular data ingestion pipelines.• Visualisation tools for oceanographic and biodiversity trends.• Integrated modules for managing taxonomy, otolith morphology, and eDNA data.• Well-documented APIs and user manuals for future adoption and scaling."

      "Problem Statement ID": "Description",
      "25042": "BackgroundThe deep ocean, encompassing vast and remote ecosystems like abyssal plains, hydrothermal vents, and seamounts, harbors a significant portion of global biodiversity, much of which remains undiscovered due to its inaccessibility. Understanding deep-sea biodiversity is critical for elucidating ecological interactions (e.g., food webs, nutrient cycling), informing conservation strategies for vulnerable marine habitats, and identifying novel eukaryotic species with potential biotechnological or ecological significance.Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive tool for studying these ecosystems by capturing genetic traces of organisms from environmental samples, such as seawater or sediment, without the need for physical collection or disturbance of fragile habitats. By targeting marker genes like 18S rRNA or COI, eDNA enables the detection of diverse eukaryotic taxa, including protists, cnidarians, and rare metazoans, offering insights into species richness and community structure.DescriptionThe Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE) will undertake routine voyages to the deep sea and collect sediment and water samples from hotspot regions for biodiversity assessment and ecosystem monitoring. The water and sediment samples will be used to extract eDNA and will be subject to high-throughput sequencing.However, assigning raw eDNA sequencing reads to eukaryotic taxa or inferring their ecological roles presents significant challenges, primarily due to the poor representation of deep-sea organisms in reference databases like SILVA, PR2, or NCBI. These databases, built primarily from well-studied terrestrial or shallow-water species, lack comprehensive sequences for deep-sea eukaryotes, leading to misclassifications, unassigned reads, or underestimation of biodiversity.Traditional bioinformatic pipelines for eDNA analysis, such as those implemented in QIIME2, DADA2, or mothur, rely heavily on sequence alignment or mapping to these databases, which is inadequate for novel or divergent deep-sea taxa. This dependency limits the discovery of new species and hinders accurate biodiversity assessments, critical for conservation in rapidly changing deep-sea environments. The computational time required for processing eDNA data exacerbates these challenges, particularly given the limitations of database-dependent methods and the complexity of eDNA datasets.Expected SolutionTo address the challenges of poor database representation and computational time in deep-sea eDNA analysis, we propose anAI-driven pipelinethat uses deep learning and unsupervised learning to identify eukaryotic taxa and assess biodiversity directly from raw eDNA reads. The solution should be able to classify the sequences, annotate and estimate abundance. This solution minimizes reliance on reference databases, reduces computational time through optimized workflows, and enables the discovery of novel taxa and ecological insights in deep-sea ecosystems."

      "Problem Statement ID": "Description",
      "25043": "BackgroundMarine biodiversity assessments rely significantly on microscopic analysis of planktonic organisms, including phytoplankton, zooplankton, and other microscopic marine life. Traditionally, counting and species identification require manual microscopic examination, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to human error.AI-enabled embedded microscopy systemsprovide an effective alternative by automating the identification, classification, and enumeration of these organisms directly at the point of sampling.DescriptionThis problem statement envisages developing anembedded intelligent systemthat can be integrated directly with microscopic imaging devices used in marine biological studies. The system should leverageembedding-based deep learning techniquesto identify and count microscopic marine organisms captured through microscopy images. The embedded platform should be optimized for low computational resources, enabling accurate, rapid, and automated analysis without manual intervention.The solution should specifically handle diverse challenges encountered in microscopic imaging, such as overlapping organisms, variations in morphology, illumination inconsistencies, and imaging artifacts. It must accurately classify and quantify different species present in microscopic images to facilitate marine biodiversity assessments efficiently.Expected SolutionAn embedded microscopy-integrated AI system featuring:• Lightweight deep learning models deployable on embedded computational hardware.• Automatic species/genus-level identification of microscopic marine organisms from microscopy images.• Accurate and automated counting of individual organisms per species.• Capability for onboard processing, storage, and reporting of species identification and counts for subsequent ecological analysis."

      "Problem Statement ID": "Description",
      "25053": "BackgroundThe majority of the farmers in India store the onion in naturally ventilated storage structures. In such structures, onions are exposed to extreme temperatures and relative humidity, which reduces the shelf life of onions and high storage loss. Improved onion storage technology will help in ensuring the availability of onions between seasons and obviate seasonal volatility in prices. The solutions could be in the form of improved, but cost-effective, materials and design of storage structures to manage temperature and relative humidity.DescriptionOnion is a semi-perishable vegetable and is harvested during the rabi season, accounting for 65% of onion production, and hits the markets from April to May. The same crop must continue to meet the consumer demand till the month of October-November every year, before the kharif crop is harvested and brought to the market. It is therefore vital to store onions successfully in order to meet the regular supply. It is observed that nearly 30-40% of the crop is lost during storage due to various reasons in form of physiological weight loss, rotting, sprouting etc. In unexpected situations such as natural calamities, the losses even go beyond 50% creating heavy stress both on the demand and supply sides. The losses that occurred during storage are in terms of qualitative as well as in quantitative ways. Hence, it is imperative to take some crucial steps pertaining to onion storage with minimum losses to ensure an adequate supply to the market, thereby reducing the price fluctuations.Various abiotic factors like temperature, relative humidity affect the health of onions; hence, their balance is essential to store the crop with minimum losses. Recent technological advancements (such as Design, Solar/Plasma/Irradiation energy, Nanotechnology, IoT including AI/ML) also offer an opportunity to provide infrastructure for onion storage and supply chain, besides value addition, even in rural India. Design innovations are pervading various sectors, including efficient onion storage at the farm level, rural as well as urban markets. Different process and product development advances will fetch better returns to farmers and competitive prices for consumers. More importantly, it will help in addressing the present as well as the impending challenges.Expected SolutionExtension of shelf life with minimum loss."

      "Problem Statement ID": "Description",
      "25055": "BackgroundAccurate and consistent preparation of cable specimens is vital for reliable testing according to Indian Standards like IS 10810 (Parts 2, 7, 33) and IS 7098 (Parts 1 & 2). These tests, including conductor resistance, insulation/sheath thickness, and flame retardance, are crucial for ensuring cable safety and quality.Existing ProblemCurrently, cable sample preparation involves significant manual intervention. The cable sample is manually cut by the operator and then straightened manually. Subsequently, these straightened PVC/XLPE/HDPE cable samples are cut into slices using electrically/pneumatically operated machines. Further, the samples are shaped as dumbbells by a dumbbell cutting machine. These manual and semi-automated steps are time-consuming, prone to human error, and introduce inconsistencies that compromise the accuracy and repeatability of critical test results.Detailed DescriptionThis project develops an automated machine designed to precisely cut insulation and outer sheaths from cables, preparing specimens that strictly adhere to the aforementioned IS standards. Key features include an Automated Cable Feeding and Clamping System utilizing motor-driven rollers and adjustable clamps for secure, straightened cable handling. The Cutting and Stripping Module employs precision blades with programmable depths for clean, circumferential cuts and linear stripping, fulfilling specific length requirements for various tests. An integrated diameter sensor will auto-adjust settings. A Control System (PLC/HMI) manages operations, allows test method selection, monitors status, and provides closed-loop feedback. Automated specimen ejection and waste management further streamline workflow. Robust safety features like enclosed areas and interlocks will protect operators.Expected SolutionThe automated machine will eliminate human error, guaranteeing consistent and repeatable specimen quality while significantly reducing preparation time and costs. By ensuring strict adherence to IS standards, the solution will yield more reliable test results and simplify product certification. This advancement will markedly improve accuracy, efficiency, and safety in cable testing, supporting high-quality control in the cable manufacturing industry."

    },
    {
      "Problem Statement ID": "Description",
      "25056": "Background:Hallmarking is the accurate determination and official recording of the proportionate content of precious metal in the jewellery/artefacts or bullion/coins. The hallmarking of gold jewellery was started in year 2000 and has been made mandatory since 23 June 2021 and presently covers 361 districts.The Indian Standard, IS 1417 2016 \"Gold and gold alloys, jewellery/artefacts-fineness and marking specification\" covers hallmarking of six grades of gold jewellery/gold artefacts viz. 14K, 18K, 20K, 22K, 23K and 24K carats. The Indian Standard, IS 1418: 2009 \"Determination of gold in gold bullion, gold alloys and gold jewellery/artefacts - Cupellation (Fire Assay) method\" prescribes the fire assay test method for determining the fineness of gold in gold bullion, alloys, and jewellery/artefacts.The fire assay testing method, though globally accepted and accurate, involves a destructive testing process wherein a sample of 250-500 mg is taken from the item by scrapping, drilling, or cutting. The method may lead to the damage of the article, rendering it unsellable, especially when dealing with a few or single article. However, the gold loss incurred during testing is almost negligible. Additionally, the process emits hazardous substances like lead oxides and nitrous fumes.Further, BIS has also formulated an Indian Standard on method of test using ED-XRF (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence), i.e., IS 18458: 2023 \"Jewellery and precious metals ED-XRF test - Method of test\". This Indian Standard prescribes a non-destructive testing method to verify the fineness of the gold jewellery. However, the use of ED-XRF as a non-destructive method to determine the fineness is only applicable to homogenous gold jewellery. In addition, IS 18458: 2023 also has a provision for determination of fineness of jewellery by destructive testing, which is more suited for non-homogeneous jewellery.There is another Indian Standard developed by BIS, IS 16901: 2022 \"Jewellery and precious metals determination of high purity gold, platinum and palladium - difference method using ICP-OES\". This method uses ICP-OES and is applicable only for high purity gold (999 ppt and above). ICP-OES is also a destructive testing method.India's gold jewellery industry is highly diverse, encompassing various types such as casted jewellery, handmade pieces with soldered joints, hollow and filled jewellery, gold-plated items, and studded ornaments using various jewellery manufacturing techniques. While casted jewellery is relatively homogeneous, the majority-particularly handmade and hollow varieties-are structurally complex and heterogeneous. This variability presents significant challenges in testing and hallmarking.In the existing fire assay testing method, heterogeneity is addressed by melting the sample before testing. This eliminates impurities and ensures homogeneity. Moreover, fire assay being a difference method (based on initial and final weight of gold sample), the impact of heterogeneity is nullified. However, owing to its destructive nature, there is strong demand for an alternative non-destructive testing method.Expected Solution:a. Develop and implement anon-destructive assaying methodthat matches the accuracy of fire assay without damaging the jewellery, while being capable of handling heterogeneous compositions (solders, fillers, non-metallic substances).b. Eliminate emissions of harmful substances (lead oxide, nitrous fumes).c. Achieve repeatability close to that of fire assay, ideally within ±0.5 ppt (as per IS 1418).d. Method selected will be validated for regulatory and commercial applications.Deliverables:a. Detailed non-destructive innovative testing method with technical explanationb. References/bibliography related to the technical paperc. Scientific principles underlying the approachd. Feasibility studies and expected challengese. Methodology for validation including accuracy assessmentf. Explanatory note on potential for regulatory and commercial application"

The entire scholarship amount - both from the State and Central Government is paid directly into the account of the students ONLY through Direct Beneficiary Transfer (DBT) enabled Aadhaar seeded bank account. However, many students are unaware of the distinction between Aadhaar linked and Direct Beneficiary Transfer (DBT) enabled Aadhaar seeded bank account. As a result, a significant number of students do not have Aadhaar-seeded bank account, leading to delays in scholarships disbursement and posing challenges for them.DescriptionThe above problem statement envisages that many students are unaware of the distinction between Aadhaar linked and Direct Beneficiary Transfer (DBT) enabled Aadhaar seeded bank account. As a result, a significant number of students do not have Aadhaar-seeded bank account, leading to delays in scholarships disbursement and posing challenges for them. Government of India is continuously providing support to promote digital inclusion, however there is need of extensive awareness on the importance and procedures of Aadhaar seeding with Bank Accounts.Expected SolutionThe students need to be made more aware about the difference between Aadhaar linked and Direct Beneficiary Transfer (DBT) enabled Aadhaar seeded bank account for availing pre & post-Matric scholarships scheme for SCs.

      "Problem Statement ID": "Description",
      "25060": "BackgroundIn FY 2021–22, India generated approximately 1.7 lakh tonnes of municipal solid waste daily, of which only 54% was scientifically treated. Around 24% was dumped in landfills and 22% remained unaccounted due to leakages in the waste management chain. This unaccounted waste is often burned or disposed of in open areas, drains, or water bodies, posing severe environmental and public health risks. (CEEW, 2025) This calls for strict solutions to enable all the waste generators to contribute to Waste Management.DescriptionOverview: According to the CPCB’s Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Annual Report for 2021-22, India generates approximately 1,70,339 tonnes of waste per day (TPD). Of this, around 1,56,449 TPD is collected. Out of the collected waste, 91,511 TPD is treated, while 41,455 TPD is disposed of in landfills. This leaves a significant gap of 37,373 TPD in effective waste management.Waste treatment: The total waste processed/treated across the country is 91,511 TPD. When compared to the total waste generated, which is 1,70,339 TPD, it is found that an average of 54% of the waste is treated/processed across the country.Solid Waste Processing Facilities: A total of 249 Waste-to-Energy plants, 819 Biomass Power plants and 50.8 lakhs small Biogas plants have been set up in the country to generate Power/Biogas/BioCNG.Expected SolutionsThe proposals aim to develop a strict system to ensure that every citizen is trained on waste management, waste workers get strict training and required safety gear, waste management facilities are present in every ULB/GP, and a dedicated decentralised monitoring system is in place. The solutions are as follows:1. Mandatory training for every citizen: Similar to countries where military training is mandatory for every citizen, in India, there shall be mandatory Waste Management training for every Waste Generator/Citizen. This will ensure source segregation, which will result in better waste management, lesser load on waste management facilities and landfills.i. Physical training on types of waste, source segregation, how to make compost at home, re-use of plastic, etc.ii. Distribution of 3 types of dustbins for dry, wet and domestic hazardous waste to every household/citizen.iii. Distribution of a designed and tested compost making kit to every household/citizen.iv. App-based monitoring.2. Phase-wise training to all Waste Workers3. Formation of Area Committee for Monitoring – to be called as “Green Champions”: Decentralised approach for Monitoring has to be done at every step of Waste Management for bulk waste generators, residential areas, commercial & Public semi-public building, Industrial buildings, etc.i. Training of all Waste Generatorsii. Waste Generation: Source segregation happening or not, no wet waste to be collectediii. Waste Collection happening on ground leveliv. Waste transportationv. Waste treatmentvi. Waste Disposal4. Incentive based approach: Incentive to Bulk waste generators and other buildings for source segregation.5. Waste Movements in ULBs: Taking example from Karnataka’s Yadgir city, “If you see waste, send photo” similar movement to be made mandatory for every ULB regardless of its size and population, to ensure community participation.6. Community Participation: One day of all working staff regardless of employment type to be engaged in Cleaning of Public areas, waste management. Inspired from Cleaning-day followed in schools every week, every waste generator to be responsible for keeping the country clean and contributing to waste management, starting from Govt. sector.7. Penalization system: Fines to be imposed and no waste collection for buildings not segregating waste at source as punishment.8. Waste Management Facilities to be made available in every ULB:i. Biomethanization plantii. W-to-E plantiii. Multiple Recycling centres for different types of wasteiv. Scrap collection shops – Online app based9. Complete Digital App-based system for:i. Training of all Waste Generatorsii. Shopping of Waste utilities – compost kits, dustbins, etc.iii. Tracking of Waste collection vehiclesiv. Location of Waste management facilities, Recycling centres, scrap shops etc.v. Option to upload geo-tagged photos of dumping sites, etc."

Low voltage distribution lines often snap due to falling trees during natural calamities and also due to aging or corrosion. This dangerous condition is not detected or isolated by upstream fuses in these feeders because of high earth resistance and low fault current, leading to electrocution deaths when people come into contact with live bare conductors. Many existing solutions identified so far are not cost-effective or viable for the vast distribution network.Expected SolutionAn innovative solution based on IoT and AI, including edge intelligence, may provide an economical and scalable solution for this socially relevant problem faced by KSEBL."

      "25064": "BackgroundKerala has a large penetration of Roof Top Solar PV systems amounting to nearly 1500 MW. These systems are connected to low voltage distribution feeders either in single-phase or three-phase mode. A majority of the systems are below 5 kW and hence get connected in single-phase, which causes severe unbalanced loading in feeders and results in an uneven voltage profile. This unbalanced loading also limits the quantum of PV that can be integrated into the network.Any load balancing work carried out during daytime under PV injection gets negated during the evening peak hours when solar power is unavailable. This situation calls for a solution that can dynamically reconfigure the network based on renewable energy (RE) injection and local demand scenarios.Expected SolutionA cost-effective controller incorporating IoT and edge intelligence can be developed at the local node level for auto-balancing of the load across various phases in a feeder under the above conditions."

      "25068": "BackgroundGroundwater is central to India's drinking, agricultural, and industrial water needs. Despite covering an area of 3.3 million square kilometers and being home to 16% of the global population, India has only 4% of the world's freshwater resources. This limited availability, combined with uneven distribution, overexploitation in some regions, and changing climate scenarios, highlights the urgent need for sustainable groundwater management. Resource knowledge is integral to the effective management of resources.Proposed SolutionTo strengthen groundwater management, it is proposed to design amobile applicationthat utilizes data from 5,260 DWLR (Digital Water Level Recorder) stations spread across the country. These stations provide high-frequency water level data, which can be leveraged to:- Analyze real-time water level fluctuations- Estimate recharge dynamically- Evaluate groundwater resources in real timeKey Features- Mobile app integration with DWLR station datasets- Visualization of water level trends and recharge patterns- Real-time groundwater availability estimation- Decision-support features for researchers, planners, and policymakersImpactThe designed app will enable stakeholders, groundwater researchers, and decision makers to have quick access to real-time groundwater availability. This will aid in scientific evaluation, informed decision-making, and the proposal of effective groundwater management interventions."

      "Problem Statement ID": "Description",
      "25069": "BackgroundAs industries increasingly emphasize sustainability,Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)is emerging not just as a tool for measuring environmental impact, but as a key strategy for advancing circularity. Metals like aluminium and copper, vital to sectors from energy to infrastructure, undergo multiple stages — from extraction and processing to use and end-of-life. Traditional linear models often result in resource depletion and waste. Modern LCA frameworks now assess not only emissions and resource use, but also the potential for reuse, recycling, and closed-loop systems. By informing decisions on product design, manufacturing, and end-of-life recovery, LCA enables a shift toward acircular economywhere materials are kept in use longer and waste is minimized.Problem StatementThere is a need to design anintuitive, AI-powered software platformthat enables metallurgists, engineers, and decision-makers to perform automated LCAs for metals such as aluminium, copper, or critical minerals, with a special emphasis oncircularity.Proposed SolutionThe platform should:- Allow users to input or select process and production details (including raw vs. recycled routes, energy use, transport, and end-of-life options).- Use AI/ML models to estimate missing parameters and predict both environmental and circularity indicators (e.g., recycled content, resource efficiency, extended product life, potential for reuse).- Visualize circular flow opportunities alongside environmental impacts across the full value chain — from raw material extraction through reuse or recycling.- Enable easy comparison of conventional and circular processing pathways.- Generate actionable reports and recommendations for reducing impacts and enhancing circularity, even when users have limited data or specialized expertise.ImpactWith this tool, the metals sector will be empowered to make practical, data-driven choices that foster environmental sustainability while advancing circular, resource-efficient systems."

A key reason why millions of old laptops and smartphones remain unused or improperly discarded isfear of data breaches. Most users hesitate to recycle their devices due to concerns about sensitive personal or organizational data being recovered. Existing data sanitization tools are either too complex, expensive, or lack verifiable proof of erasure. This gap has led to over ₹50,000 crore worth of IT assets being hoarded in homes and offices, hindering circular economy efforts. Auser-friendly, tamper-proof, and auditable data wiping solutionis urgently needed to promote safe disposal and reuse of electronic devices.Problem StatementDesign and prototype asecure, cross-platform data wiping applicationthat works onWindows, Linux, and Android devices. The tool must:- Securely erase all user data, including hidden storage areas like HPA/DCO and SSD sectors.- Generate a digitally signed, tamper-proof wipe certificate (in PDF and JSON formats).- Feature an intuitive one-click interface suitable for general public use.- Offer offline usability (e.g., bootable ISO/USB).- Enable third-party verification of wipe status.- Be scalable, standards-compliant (aligned withNIST SP 800-88), and support trust and transparency in IT asset disposal and recycling workflows.ImpactThis solution will build user confidence in device recycling, reduce hoarding of IT assets, promotesafe e-waste management, and advance India’scircular economyinitiatives."

      "Problem Statement ID": "Description",
      "25080": "Since its first commercial run in 2017, KMRL has grown into a complex, multidisciplinary enterprise that stretches far beyond train operations. Every business day the organization generates and receives thousands of pages of material: engineering drawings, maintenance job cards, incident reports, vendor invoices, purchase-order correspondence, regulatory directives, environmental-impact studies, safety circulars, HR policies, legal opinions, and board-meeting minutes. These arrive through e-mail, Maximo exports, SharePoint repositories, WhatsApp PDFs, hard-copy scans, and ad-hoc cloud links—often in both English and Malayalam, sometimes in bilingual hybrids, frequently with embedded tables, photos, or signatures. The sheer diversity and volume have created a silent productivity tax: \n● Information latency: Front-line managers spend hours skimming lengthy documents for the few actionable lines that affect their shift, delaying decisions on train availability, contractor payments, or staffing reallocations. \n● Siloed awareness: Procurement may negotiate a spare-parts contract without realizing that Engineering has already flagged an upcoming design change HR may schedule refresher training unaware of a new safety bulletin released the previous evening.\n● Compliance exposure: Regulatory updates from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety and the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs are buried in inboxes, risking missed deadlines or audit non-conformities. \n● Knowledge attrition: Institutional memory remains locked in static files when key personnel transfer or retire, hard-won insights vanish with them. \n● Duplicated effort: Different teams independently create summaries or slide decks of the same source documents, multiplying manual work and version-control headaches. \n\nAs KMRL prepares to expand its corridor, add two new depots, and integrate emerging technologies such as Unified Namespace (UNS) data streams and IoT condition monitoring, the documentary burden will only intensify. Without an organization-wide mechanism to condense, contextualize, and route critical information, the metro risks slower decision cycles, avoidable operating costs, diminished service reliability, and heightened safety and legal vulnerabilities. The challenge, therefore, is to equip every stakeholder—from station controllers and rolling-stock engineers to finance officers and executive directors—with rapid, trustworthy snapshots of the documents that matter to them, while preserving traceability to the original source. Solving this problem will unlock faster cross-department coordination, strengthen regulatory compliance, safeguard institutional knowledge, and ultimately support KMRL’s mission of delivering safe, efficient, and passenger-centric urban transit to Kochi."

      "Problem Statement ID": "Description",
      "25081": "Kochi Metro must decide every night which of its 25 four-car trainsets will enter revenue service at dawn, which remain on standby, and which are held back in the Inspection Bay Line (IBL) for maintenance. The decision hinges on six inter-dependent variables: \n1. Fitness Certificates – validity windows issued by Rolling-Stock, Signalling and Telecom departments.\n2. Job-Card Status – open vs. closed work orders exported from IBM Maximo. \n3. Branding Priorities – contractual commitments that dictate exterior wrap exposure hours. \n4. Mileage Balancing – kilometre allocation to equalise bogie, brake-pad and HVAC wear. \n5. Cleaning & Detailing Slots – available manpower and bay occupancy for interior deep-cleaning. \n6. Stabling Geometry – physical bay positions that minimise nightly shunting and morning turn-out time. \nAt present these data points reside in siloed spreadsheets, manual logbooks, and daily WhatsApp updates. Supervisors reconcile them in a time-compressed window (21:00–23:00 IST) using ad-hoc filters and experience-based heuristics. The process is opaque, non-repeatable, and highly error-prone:\n● Missing a single telecom clearance can force an unscheduled rake withdrawal, eroding the 99.5 % punctuality KPI. \n● Uneven mileage assignment accelerates component fatigue, inflating maintenance cost. \n● Inadequate visibility into branding priorities risks breaching advertiser SLAs, exposing KMRL to revenue penalties. \n● Excessive night-time shunting to rearrange rakes increases energy consumption and track-occupancy safety risk. With fleet size slated to grow to 40 trainsets and two depots by 2027, the existing manual workflow cannot scale linearly—neither in staffing nor in cognitive load. Therefore, KMRL requires an integrated, algorithm-driven decision-support platform that can: \n● Ingest heterogeneous inputs (Maximo exports, IoT fitness sensors, UNS streams, manual overrides) in near-real-time. \n● Enforce rule-based constraints and multi-objective optimisation (service readiness, reliability, cost, branding exposure). \n● Generate a ranked induction list with explainable reasoning, conflict alerts, and “what-if” simulation. \n● Learn from historical outcomes via machine-learning feedback loops to improve forecast accuracy over time. \nSuch a system will transform induction planning from a manual reconciliation exercise into a reproducible, auditable, data-driven process—delivering higher fleet availability, lower lifecycle cost, and an enhanced passenger experience while freeing operations staff to focus on strategic exceptions rather than routine data wrangling."

These programs feature flexible, creditbased, multidisciplinary structures allowing students to choose Major, Minor, Skill-Based, Ability Enhancement, and Value-Added courses. Manual timetable creation under this new framework has become extremely complex, involving numerous subject combinations, varying credit hours, student preferences, and faculty workload distribution. To manage this, colleges usually form dedicated timetable committees, but even then, clashes, underutilization of faculty, and scheduling inefficiencies persist.Description:This problem statement envisions the development of a web-based or hybrid intelligent system that can generate automated, conflict-free, optimized academic timetables alignment with the NEP 2020 course structure. The system must integrate:- Student data (elective choices, enrolled credits)- Curriculum structure (course codes, credits, theory/practical split)- Faculty workload, availability, and expertise- Room/lab availability and capacity- Teaching practice schedules (especially relevant for B.Ed. and M.Ed.)- Field work, internships, and project componentsThe system should also allow dynamic editing, scenario simulation, and scalability for upcoming semesters. A user-friendly admin interface is essential to allow real-time inputs and updates.Expected Solution:A deployable AI/ML-assisted Timetable Generator that:- Accepts structured inputs from academic, student, and faculty databases- Generates a semester-wise timetable for multiple programs (B.Ed., M.Ed., FYUP, ITEP)- Prevents scheduling conflicts across faculty and infrastructure- Accommodates future course additions and changing NEP guidelines- Offers exportable formats (PDF, Excel) for student and faculty sharing- Can be integrated with existing Academic Management Systems"

There is no centralized digital platform that enables institutions to document, track, and showcase a student's complete profile, including:- Conferences and workshops attended- Certifications earned- Club activities and volunteering efforts- Competitions and academic contests- Leadership roles and internships- Community services doneThis gap not only hampers institutional efficiency but also limits students' ability to build a verified and dynamic portfolio that could support job applications, higher education admissions, and skill recognition. In addition, during events like NAAC accreditation, the lack of consolidated data becomes a major administrative challenge.Description:The above problem necessitates the development of a Smart Student Hub (Mobile + Web Application) that acts as a centralized student record and achievement management platform.Key Features include:-Dynamic Student Dashboard:Real-time updates on academic performance, attendance, and credit-based activities.-Activity Tracker:Upload and validate participation in seminars, conferences, online courses (e.g., MOOCs), internships, and extra-curriculars.-Faculty Approval Panel:Faculty or admin can approve uploaded records to maintain credibility.-Auto-Generated Digital Portfolio:Downloadable and shareable verified student portfolio in PDF or web link format.-Analytics & Reporting:For institutions to generate reports for NAAC, AICTE, NIRF, or internal evaluations.-Integration Support:Can link with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS), ERP, or digital university platforms.Impact and Benefits:- Empowers students with a verified, holistic digital profile.- Facilitates career planning, placements, and scholarship/higher studies applications.- Reduces administrative burden during audits and accreditations.- Encourages participation in co-curricular activities by making achievements visible and valued.- Promotes data-driven decision-making at the institutional level.Expected Solution:We propose the development of a mobile + web-based application that can digitally catalogue and manage a student's academic and non-academic achievements throughout their time in college. The proposed protocol will:- Build a verified, holistic student profile from Day 1- Reduce paperwork and improve transparency- Make students better prepared for placements, fellowships, or postgraduate admissions- Empower faculty with real-time data for mentoring and tracking- Align with the digital transformation goals of higher education institutions- Enhance institutional efficiency during accreditation or policy auditsThis will bridge the gap by offering an all-in-one solution that empowers students, simplifies faculty tasks, and modernizes institutional operations."

      "25094": "BackgroundThe decline in student enrollment in government degree colleges is not a consequence of poor infrastructure or lack of teaching resources. At the heart of the problem lies a critical gap in awareness, most students and often their parents do not understand the importance of graduation, what career opportunities different degree courses unlock, or how to choose a subject stream based on personal interest and future prospects. After passing Class 10 or 12, students face confusion about:- Which subject stream (Arts, Science, Commerce) to opt for.- What kind of degree programs are available in nearby government colleges.- What jobs or higher studies they can pursue after choosing a particular course.- Whether pursuing graduation is even worth the effort, especially when short-term job or skill-based courses seem more accessible.This lack of clarity leads to poor academic decisions, dropouts, or migration to private institutions that often promise but fail to deliver quality education.DescriptionThe above problem statement envisages that a customized Digital Guidance Platform for students should be developed as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor.Key Features of the App/Web Platform:-Aptitude & Interest-Based Course Suggestion:Short quizzes to assess the student's interests, strengths and personality traits. Based on results, the app will suggest suitable streams and subjects (Arts, Science, Commerce, Vocational). Students can compare career paths based on different combinations.-Course-to-Career Path Mapping:Detailed visual charts showing what each degree (B.A., B.Sc., B.Com., BBA, etc.) offers. The industries or sectors each course leads to and relevant government exams, private jobs, entrepreneurial options, or higher education available after each stream.-Nearby Government Colleges Directory:Location-based listing of government colleges, information on available degree programs; cut-offs and eligibility, medium of instruction, facilities (hostel, lab, library, internet access).-Timeline Tracker:Notification system for admission dates, scholarship application windows, college entrance tests or counseling schedules.-Customization and Personalization:User profiles created at login — tracking age, gender, class, academic interests. AI-driven recommendation engine suggests:• Courses to apply for.• Colleges nearby.• Career paths aligned with their aptitude.• Study materials tailored to subject choice.Implementation Strategy-Stakeholder Collaboration:Involve government education departments, school teachers, NGOs, and counselors for content and outreach.-Technology Development:Partner with EdTech developers to build a scalable, lightweight app with offline features for poor internet areas.-Pilot Launch:Start in one or two districts with low college enrollment. Get feedback from students and teachers.-Full-Scale Rollout:Roll out state-wide or nationally through government schools and skill centers.-Monitoring & Feedback:Real-time analytics to track usage, app suggestions, successful transitions to college enrollment.Expected SolutionWe propose the development of a mobile + web-based application that acts as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor. The platform will be designed for students guiding them in choosing the right subject combination after class 12th, selecting suitable degree courses in local government colleges, understanding the long-term outcomes of different courses (jobs, entrance exams, skill development) and accessing open-source e-books, skill materials, and scholarships.Impact- Improved enrollment in government degree colleges by helping students make informed academic decisions.- Reduced dropouts after Class 10 and 12.- Empowered students with access to reliable, localized career guidance.- Stronger perception of government colleges as viable career-building institutions."

Such software fails to account for the unpredictable and nuanced realities of Indian roads—such as potholes, temporary barricades, partial lane closures, construction activities, and erratic driver behaviors.\n\nManually modeling these complex and dynamic road features into digital twins for realistic traffic simulations is both tedious and time-consuming, often requiring significant engineering effort before any meaningful simulation can be conducted.\n\nTo address this challenge, MathWorks is seeking innovative solutions to accelerate the creation of highly detailed digital twins of existing Indian road junctions and networks. The aim is to design toolsets, templates, asset libraries, or workflows—leveraging MATLAB, Simulink, Automated Driving Toolbox, RoadRunner, and potentially generative AI—that significantly streamline the process.\n\nThe solution should enable users to easily incorporate typical Indian road features and simulate hyper-local vehicular behaviors in their modeling, thereby empowering traffic management agencies to run realistic simulations for crisis handling, congestion management, and infrastructure planning.\n\nProposals should focus on enhancing the modeling process rather than traffic optimization and must integrate seamlessly with MATLAB-based simulation workflows.\n\nFor more information on relevant tools, please refer to the following links:\n\nDriving Scenario Designer – Design driving scenarios, configure sensors, and generate synthetic data – MATLAB\nhttps://in.mathworks.com/help/driving/ref/drivingscenariodesigner-app.html?requestedDomain=\n\nGitHub - MathWorks/OpenTrafficLab\nhttps://github.com/mathworks/OpenTrafficLab\n\nCreate Driving Scenario Variations Programmatically – MATLAB & Simulink\nhttps://in.mathworks.com/help/driving/ug/create-driving-scenario-variations-programmatically.html?requestedDomain=\n\nSensor Simulation and Virtual Scene Design with the Driving Scenario Designer App, Part 1 – MATLAB\nhttps://in.mathworks.com/videos/driving-scenario-designer-1529302116471.html?s_tid=srchtitle_videos_main_1_driving+scenario\n\nImport OpenStreetMap Data into Driving Scenario – MATLAB & Simulink\nhttps://in.mathworks.com/help/driving/ug/import-openstreetmap-data-into-driving-scenario.html"

      "25101": "Background:\nRural diploma colleges often operate without subject Lecturers in various fields\nsuch as artificial intelligence, VLSI, or renewable energy. Students must rely on self-study material or travel to cities for coaching,deepening the urban-rural learning divide.\nDescription:\nThe challenge is less about willingness than about infrastructure. Typical village campuses juggle low and unstable data speeds, making conventional video-conferencing unreliable. Previous interventions failed when platforms assumed  high-bandwidth links or required complicated equipment. To succeed, a new approach must embrace low-bandwidth realities, prioritise audio quality, compress visual content, and ensure that learning can continue even during connectivity lapses. It should encourage synchronous interaction yet also provide recordings that remain small enough for easy download on limited data plans. Faculty in cities need a simple way to deliver lectures from any quiet corner, while rural students require a user experience that functions on entry-level smartphones. Interactive elements quizzes, polls, discussion boards-must remain functional at low speeds.Crucially, the entire solution should minimise the leaming curve for educators and be financially sustainable for resource-constrained institutes. By offering a design that blends live engagement with asynchronous access, the college can bring expert instruction to every campus without waiting for large capital investments.This is precisely the sort of context-aware challenge that Smart India Hackathon teams can address through innovative but lightweight software solutions.\nExpected Solution:\nStudent teams should outline a software-only virtual-classroom ecosystem that delivers clear audio and concise visual content on limited bandwidth, supports interactive live as well as recorded sessions, and allows easy content access for learners who may need to download materials during off-peak hours-all without relying on specialised hardware or costly licences."

      "25102": "Background:\nBy the time term-end marks reveal failures, many struggling students have disengaged beyond recovery. Counsellors and mentors need a mechanism that surfaces risk indicators-faliing attendance, high number of attempts exhausted to pass a particular subject, reducing test scores-weeks earlier.\nDescription:\nAttendance percentages live in one spreadsheet, test results in another, and fee-payment data in a third. No single view exists to signal that a learner is slipping in multiple areas simultaneously.\nCommercial analytics platforms promise predictive insights but demand funds and maintenance beyond the reach of public institutes. A simpler, transparent approach would merge existing spreadsheets,apply clear logic to colour-code risk,and notify mentors on a predictable schedule.Such a system\nmust be easy to configure, require minimal training, and empower educators-not replace their judgment. By focusing on data fusion and timely alerts rather than complex algorithms, the institute can intervene early and reduce drop-out rates without fresh budget lines.This challenge epitomises the hackathon spirit: take what is already present, integrate it cleverly, and produce meaningful impact using\nmachine learning.\nExpected SoIution:\nParticipants  are expected to build a consolidated digitaI dashboard that automatically ingests attendance,assessment scores, and other student related dala;applies clear, rule-based  thresholds to identify at-risk students; highIights them in an intuitive visual format; and dispatches regular notifications to mentors and guardians, ensuring early,data-driven intervention achieved entirely through suitable machine learning approaches."

      "25103": "Background:\nAdmissions, fee collection, hostel allocation, and examination records are maintained in separate ledgers. Students queue at multiple counters; staff re-enter identical data; and administrators lack a real-time institutional overview.\nDescription:\nComprehensive ERP suites can unify data but remain out of financial reach for many public colleges. Yet much of the required functionality-customised online forms, central data tables, automated receipts, real-time dashboards-already exists in ubiquitous cloud office suites. By intelligently connecting these services, an institution can create a single source of truth without large capital outlay. Essential components include streamlined admission intake, automated fee receipting, live hostel occupancy tracking, and summary dashboards for higher officials. Data security, role-based access and regular back-ups must be baked in from day one. Because staff is already familiar with basic spreadsheet and form tools, the learning curve remains shallow, ensuring broad adoption. Hackathon participants can demonstrate how thoughtful process mapping and lightweight scripting turn an assortment of familiar apps into a cohesive, low-cost ERP that any college can replicate.

A multilingual chatbot that understands Hindi, English, and an additional local language can deflect routine inquiries, freeing staff for complex tasks. Modern conversational-Al services offer drag-and-drop interfaces. Key requirements include accurate intent recognition, context management across multiple turns, fallback to human contact when necessary, and daily conversation logs for continuous improvement. Embedding the chatbot on the college website and popular messaging platforms maximises reach. Crucially, the solution must respect privacy, ensure response accuracy, and remain maintainable by student volunteers after the hackathon concludes. By focusing on content curation and user-centric design, participants can deliver high impact solution quickly.\n\nExpected Solution:\nStudent innovators should develop a multilingual conversational assistant that ingests institutional FAQs, recognises and responds to student queries in at least five regional languages, maintains context across follow-up questions, logs interactions for review, and integrates seamlessly into the college's existing web and messaging channels-achieving equitable, round-the-clock information access in a user friendly manner."
